<h1>02. The Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Why right triangles obey a law about squares, and what it unlocks</p>

<!-- ============================== THE PROBLEM ============================== -->

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The Problem</div>
  <p>
    You're building a house. You need the corner walls to meet at exactly 90 degrees.
    No protractor, no laser level &mdash; you have a rope and some stakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Egyptian builders figured this out thousands of years ago: tie 12 equally spaced
    knots in a rope, stretch it into a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 knots long.
    The corner opposite the longest side is always a perfect right angle.
  </p>
  <p>
    It works every time. But <strong>why</strong>? What's special about 3, 4, 5?
    Does it work for other numbers? And given two sides of a right triangle,
    can you always find the third?
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ============================== HISTORY ============================== -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical Note</div>
  <p>
    The Babylonians knew this relationship by at least 1800 BC. Clay tablet
    <strong>Plimpton 322</strong>, sitting in the Columbia University library,
    lists fifteen Pythagorean triples &mdash; sets of integers satisfying the
    theorem &mdash; over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    The theorem is named after <strong>Pythagoras of Samos</strong> (~570&ndash;495 BC),
    who allegedly gave the first proof, though no written record of his proof survives.
    Chinese mathematicians proved it independently around 200 BC in the
    <em>Zhoubi Suanjing</em>, using a beautiful visual argument we'll see below.
  </p>
  <p>
    This theorem has more known proofs than any other in mathematics &mdash; over 370.
    Contributors include Euclid, the Indian mathematician Bhaskara II (who wrote
    just "Behold!" next to his diagram), US President James Garfield (1876), and
    in 2023, two high-school students from New Orleans who produced a trigonometric
    proof that mathematicians had long thought impossible.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ============================== THE THEOREM ============================== -->

<h2>The theorem</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Pythagorean Theorem</div>
  <p>
    In a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$
    (the side opposite the right angle):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  That's the algebraic statement. But algebra came two thousand years after Pythagoras.
  The original meaning is geometric, and it's worth seeing that first.
</p>

<!-- ============================== GEOMETRIC MEANING ============================== -->

<h2>What $a^2$ actually means &mdash; the geometric view</h2>

<p>
  Build a square on each side of the triangle. The square on side $a$ has area $a^2$.
  The square on side $b$ has area $b^2$. The square on the hypotenuse $c$ has area $c^2$.
</p>

<p>
  The theorem says: <strong>the area of the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of
  the areas of the squares on the two legs.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This is the original meaning. It's a statement about land, about physical area.
  The Greeks didn't think of $a^2$ as "$a$ times $a$" &mdash; they thought of it as
  "the square whose side is $a$." When you read "the square on the hypotenuse,"
  they meant a literal square, drawn on papyrus or scratched in sand.

<!-- ============================== PROOF 1 ============================== -->

<h2>Proof 1 &mdash; The Chinese visual proof</h2>

<p>
  This is perhaps the most elegant proof in all of mathematics.
  It requires nothing beyond the area of a triangle ($\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$)
  and expanding a binomial. It appeared in the <em>Zhoubi Suanjing</em> around 200 BC.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof 1 &mdash; Area rearrangement</div>
  <p>
    Start with a right triangle having legs $a$, $b$ and hypotenuse $c$. Make four identical copies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Arrange the four triangles inside a large square of side length
    $(a + b)$, with their hypotenuses facing inward. They fit perfectly, leaving a tilted
    square in the centre whose side is $c$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Compute the area of the large square two ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Way 1</em> &mdash; directly:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$
  </div>
  <p>
    <em>Way 2</em> &mdash; as four triangles plus the inner square:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}ab + c^2 = 2ab + c^2$$
  </div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> These are the same area, so set them equal:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2$$
  </div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Subtract $2ab$ from both sides:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
  </div>
  <p class="qed">&#8718;</p>
</div>

<p>
  The entire proof rests on one fact: the four triangles plus the inner square tile the
  big square with no gaps or overlaps. Once you see that, the algebra is three lines.
  This is why Bhaskara could get away with writing just "Behold!" &mdash; the diagram
  does the work.

<!-- ============================== PROOF 2 ============================== -->

<h2>Proof 2 &mdash; Euclid's proof (I.47)</h2>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof 2 &mdash; Via similar triangles (Euclid)</div>
  <p>
    This is the proof in Euclid's <em>Elements</em>, Proposition I.47, from around 300 BC.
    It connects directly to what we saw on the
    <a href="01-similar-triangles.html" style="color:#4a9;">previous page</a>
    about similar triangles.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Setup.</strong> Take right triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at $C$.
    Drop the altitude from $C$ perpendicular to the hypotenuse $AB$, hitting it at point $D$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Key observation.</strong> This altitude splits the original triangle into two smaller
    triangles: $ACD$ and $CBD$. Both are similar to the original triangle $ABC$.
    (They share an angle with the original, and both have a right angle &mdash;
    so by AA similarity, they're similar.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>From similarity of $\triangle ACD \sim \triangle ABC$:</strong>
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{AC}{AB} = \frac{AD}{AC} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad AC^2 = AB \cdot AD$$
  </div>
  <p>
    That is: $b^2 = c \cdot AD$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>From similarity of $\triangle CBD \sim \triangle ABC$:</strong>
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{BD}{BC} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad BC^2 = AB \cdot BD$$
  </div>
  <p>
    That is: $a^2 = c \cdot BD$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Add them.</strong> Since $D$ lies on $AB$, we have $AD + BD = AB = c$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$a^2 + b^2 = c \cdot BD + c \cdot AD = c(AD + BD) = c \cdot c = c^2$$
  </div>
  <p class="qed">&#8718;</p>
</div>

<p>
  Notice how different this feels from Proof 1. No area rearrangement, no binomial expansion.
  Just similar triangles and the fact that the two segments of the hypotenuse add back to the whole.
  Euclid's proof makes the Pythagorean theorem a <em>consequence</em> of similarity &mdash;
  which is arguably the deeper insight.
</p>

<!-- ============================== VERIFICATION ============================== -->

<h2>Verify it</h2>

<p>
  Before trusting the theorem, let's check it against known right triangles.
</p>

<p><strong>The 3-4-5 triangle</strong> (the Egyptian rope trick):</p>
<div class="display-math">
  $$3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 \quad\checkmark$$
</div>

<p><strong>The 5-12-13 triangle:</strong></p>
<div class="display-math">
  $$5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2 \quad\checkmark$$
</div>

<p><strong>The 8-15-17 triangle:</strong></p>
<div class="display-math">
  $$8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289 = 17^2 \quad\checkmark$$
</div>

<p>
  These integer triples $(a, b, c)$ satisfying $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ are called
  <strong>Pythagorean triples</strong>. There are infinitely many of them.
  Euclid gave a formula: for any positive integers $m > n$,
  the triple $(m^2 - n^2,\; 2mn,\; m^2 + n^2)$ works. Try $m=2, n=1$:
  $(3, 4, 5)$. Try $m=3, n=2$: $(5, 12, 13)$.
</p>

<!-- ============================== THE CONVERSE ============================== -->

<h2>The converse</h2>

<p>
  The theorem goes the other direction too. Not just "right triangle implies $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$,"
  but also:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Converse of Pythagoras</div>
  <p>
    If a triangle has sides $a$, $b$, $c$ with $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$,
    then the angle opposite side $c$ is a right angle.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  This is precisely what the Egyptian builders used. They didn't need to prove
  a triangle was right-angled by measuring the angle. They measured the sides instead.
  Mark 3, 4, 5 on a rope, pull it taut into a triangle, and the corner opposite the
  longest side is guaranteed to be 90 degrees. The converse is what makes the theorem
  <em>practical</em>.
</p>

<!-- ============================== CONSEQUENCE ============================== -->

<h2>A consequence that changes everything</h2>

<p>
  Draw a square with side length 1. What is its diagonal?
</p>

<p>
  The diagonal splits the square into two right triangles, each with legs $1$ and $1$.
  By Pythagoras:
</p>

<div class="display-math">
  $$d^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$$
</div>

<p>
  So $d = \sqrt{2}$. This is a real, constructible length &mdash; you can draw it with
  a compass and straightedge. It sits right there on the page.
</p>

<p>
  But here's the problem. The Pythagoreans believed all lengths are ratios of whole numbers.
  Every distance, they claimed, is some fraction $p/q$. If that's true, then $\sqrt{2}$
  must be a fraction. Is it?
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="03-sqrt2-irrational.html" style="color:#e94560;">next page</a> proves it isn't.
  $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as any fraction. This discovery &mdash; a direct consequence
  of the Pythagorean theorem applied to the humblest possible triangle &mdash; allegedly
  caused a crisis in the Pythagorean school. Legend has it that the discoverer, Hippasus,
  was drowned at sea for revealing the secret.
</p>

<p>
  The theorem that bears their name led straight to the destruction of their worldview.
</p>

<!-- ============================== WHAT BREAKS ============================== -->

<hr>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What Breaks Without This</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Distance in coordinate geometry is the Pythagorean theorem.</strong>
    The distance between points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
  </div>
  <p>
    This is just Pythagoras applied to the horizontal and vertical legs of a right triangle.
    Without it, Descartes' entire coordinate system
    (<a href="06-coordinate-geometry.html" style="color:#aaa;">page 06</a>) has no way to
    measure distance. No distance formula means no circles, no conic sections, no calculus
    of curves, no physics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Trigonometry collapses.</strong> The identity
    $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ is the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle.
    Without it, there's no coherent relationship between sine and cosine.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Higher dimensions vanish.</strong> Distance in 3D &mdash;
    $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ &mdash; is iterated Pythagoras. In $n$ dimensions,
    same idea. Without the 2D case, there's no generalisation.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ============================== TAKEAWAY ============================== -->

<hr>

<div class="oneliner">
  The areas of the squares on the legs add up to the area of the square on the hypotenuse &mdash;
  that's why $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
