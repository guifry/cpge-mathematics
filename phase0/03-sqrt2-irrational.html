<h1>√2 is Irrational</h1>
<p class="subtitle">The First Crisis — Phase 0, Page 3</p>

<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The crisis</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    The Pythagoreans (~500 BC) built their entire worldview on a single axiom:
    <strong>all numbers are ratios of whole numbers</strong>. "All is number" — and by <em>number</em>
    they meant <em>ratio</em>. Every length, every harmony, every cosmic proportion could be expressed
    as some fraction $p/q$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then someone drew a unit square and asked a fatal question. By the Pythagorean theorem
    (which we proved on the previous page), the diagonal has length
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$d = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$$</div>
  <p>
    So: <strong>what fraction equals $\sqrt{2}$?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. TRY TO FIND IT ──────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Try to find it</h2>

<p>
  Your calculator says $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421356\ldots$ — the decimal goes on without repeating.
  Let's try some fractions:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Fraction</th><th>Decimal</th><th>Error</th></tr>
  <tr><td>$7/5$</td><td>$1.400$</td><td>$0.014$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$141/100$</td><td>$1.410$</td><td>$0.004$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$1414/1000$</td><td>$1.414$</td><td>$0.0002$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$19601/13860$</td><td>$1.4142135\ldots$</td><td>$< 10^{-8}$</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Each fraction gets closer. But no fraction lands exactly on $\sqrt{2}$. Maybe we
  just haven't tried hard enough? Maybe the right fraction has a very large denominator
  and we simply haven't stumbled on it?
</p>

<p>
  The Pythagoreans must have felt this. The diagonal <em>exists</em> — you can draw it with
  a straightedge — but no ratio captures it. The proof that it <strong>never will</strong>
  is one of the oldest and most beautiful arguments in all of mathematics.
</p>

<!-- ─── 3. HISTORY ──────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Legend says the Pythagoreans were so disturbed by this discovery that they drowned
    Hippasus at sea for revealing it. Whether true or apocryphal, the story captures
    something real: this result <strong>destroyed the foundation of Pythagorean mathematics</strong>.
    A length that physically exists — you can construct it with compass and straightedge — but
    that cannot be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers. Their entire metaphysics, built on the
    primacy of ratio, was broken.
  </p>
  <p>
    The discovery of incommensurable magnitudes (as the Greeks called them) triggered a
    centuries-long reformulation of Greek geometry. Eudoxus (~370 BC) eventually developed
    a theory of proportion that could handle irrational ratios — a theory so careful that
    it anticipated Dedekind's construction of the real numbers in 1872, over two millennia later.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 4. DEFINITIONS ──────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What "irrational" means, precisely</h2>

<p>
  A <strong>rational number</strong> is any number that can be written as $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$
  are integers and $q \neq 0$. Examples: $3/4$, $-7/1$, $0/1$. Every terminating or repeating
  decimal is rational (e.g. $0.333\ldots = 1/3$).
</p>

<p>
  An <strong>irrational number</strong> is a real number that is <em>not</em> rational. It cannot be written as
  $p/q$ for <em>any</em> integers $p, q$. Not "we haven't found the right fraction" — there is provably
  no such fraction. The decimal expansion goes on forever without ever settling into a repeating pattern.
</p>

<p>
  The claim: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
</p>

<!-- ─── 5. PROOF METHOD ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The proof method: contradiction</h2>

<p>
  Before we prove anything, let's understand the <em>technique</em> we'll use.
  <strong>Proof by contradiction</strong> works like this:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>You want to prove that statement $X$ is true.</li>
  <li>You <em>assume</em> $X$ is false.</li>
  <li>You reason logically from that assumption, following every step carefully.</li>
  <li>You arrive at a <strong>contradiction</strong> — something impossible, like $1 = 0$ or "this fraction is both in lowest terms and not in lowest terms".</li>
  <li>Since the logic was valid, the only thing that could be wrong is the assumption. Therefore $X$ is true.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Think of it like a detective. "If the suspect were innocent, he'd have been at home at 9pm.
  But we have camera footage showing he wasn't home at 9pm. Contradiction.
  Therefore, he's not innocent." The logic is airtight — the only escape is to reject the hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
  Our hypothesis to destroy: "$\sqrt{2}$ is rational."
</p>

<!-- ─── 6. THEOREM ──────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem</div>
  <p>
    $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. That is, there exist no integers $p, q$ with $q \neq 0$
    such that $\sqrt{2} = \dfrac{p}{q}$.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 7. THE PROOF ────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Assume the opposite.</strong>
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ <em>is</em> rational. Then we can write
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$$</div>
  <p>
    where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers with <strong>no common factor</strong> — that is, the
    fraction is in lowest terms. (Why can we assume this? If $p$ and $q$ shared a common factor,
    we'd just divide it out. For instance, $6/4$ becomes $3/2$. Every fraction can be reduced
    to lowest terms. So we lose nothing by starting there.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Square both sides.</strong>
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$$</div>
  <p>
    Multiply both sides by $q^2$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$p^2 = 2q^2$$</div>
  <p>
    This is the equation we'll squeeze a contradiction from.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3. $p$ must be even.</strong>
    The equation says $p^2 = 2q^2$. The right side is $2 \times (\text{something})$, so $p^2$
    is even (divisible by 2).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now here is the <strong>key step</strong>: if $p^2$ is even, then $p$ itself must be even. Why?
    Consider the only alternative: suppose $p$ were odd. Every odd number has the form $2m + 1$
    for some integer $m$. Square it:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$(2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 2(2m^2 + 2m) + 1$$</div>
  <p>
    That's odd. So: <em>odd squared is always odd</em>. Equivalently, <em>if $p^2$ is even, then
    $p$ cannot be odd</em>. Therefore $p$ is even.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4. Substitute.</strong>
    Since $p$ is even, write $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Plug into $p^2 = 2q^2$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$(2k)^2 = 2q^2$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$4k^2 = 2q^2$$</div>
  <p>
    Divide both sides by 2:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$q^2 = 2k^2$$</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5. $q$ must be even.</strong>
    By exactly the same argument as Step 3 — $q^2 = 2k^2$ means $q^2$ is even,
    which forces $q$ to be even.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 6. Contradiction.</strong>
    We now have: $p$ is even <em>and</em> $q$ is even. Both are divisible by 2. But we assumed
    in Step 1 that $p/q$ was in lowest terms — that $p$ and $q$ share no common factor.
    Having a common factor of 2 directly contradicts this assumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since our logic was valid at every step, the only thing that can be wrong is the
    assumption we started with. Therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational. $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<!-- ─── 8. UNPACKING ────────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Unpacking the proof</h2>

<p>
  Let's look at <em>why</em> this works, not just <em>that</em> it works.
</p>

<p>
  The engine of the proof is <strong>parity</strong> — the even/odd distinction. The number 2 has a
  special property: when you square a fraction in lowest terms, the 2 in the numerator
  ($p^2 = 2q^2$) forces $p$ to absorb a factor of 2. But then $p = 2k$, so $p^2 = 4k^2$,
  and the equation $4k^2 = 2q^2$ forces $q$ to absorb a factor of 2 as well.
</p>

<p>
  It's a chain reaction. The factor of 2 is <em>contagious</em>: it infects $p$, then through the
  equation it infects $q$. But a fraction in lowest terms is supposed to be immune to shared
  factors. That's the contradiction.
</p>

<p>
  Notice the proof would work just as well for $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, or $\sqrt{p}$ for any
  prime $p$. The argument generalises: $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational whenever $n$ is not a perfect
  square. The mechanism is always the same — a prime factor that contaminates both numerator
  and denominator.
</p>

<!-- ─── 9. CONSEQUENCES ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>
  This isn't a curiosity. It's a structural revelation about numbers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The rationals have holes.</strong> The number $\sqrt{2}$ is a definite point on the number
  line — you can construct it geometrically, pin it down with arbitrary precision. But it doesn't
  exist in the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$. If your number system is $\mathbb{Q}$, this point
  is a gap, a void.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Limits can escape.</strong> Consider the sequence $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, \ldots$
  — each term is rational, and the sequence clearly "converges" to something. But the thing it
  converges to ($\sqrt{2}$) isn't in $\mathbb{Q}$. The limit doesn't exist in your number system.
  This is catastrophic for doing analysis (calculus, differential equations, anything involving limits)
  over $\mathbb{Q}$ alone.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>This is why $\mathbb{R}$ was invented.</strong> The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are, at
  their core, the rationals with all the holes filled in. The formal constructions — Dedekind cuts
  (1872) or Cauchy sequences — are specifically designed to close exactly these gaps. Every "convergent"
  sequence of rationals gets a limit in $\mathbb{R}$, even when that limit is irrational.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Looking ahead.</strong> In Phase 1, we'll study the <em>completeness</em> of $\mathbb{R}$ — the
  precise property that guarantees $\mathbb{R}$ has no holes. That property is the direct fix for the crisis
  we've just uncovered. The entire edifice of analysis (continuity, differentiation, integration, convergence)
  rests on completeness, which rests on the fact that $\mathbb{Q}$ is broken in exactly the way this
  proof demonstrates.
</p>

<!-- ─── 10. WHAT BREAKS ─────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    If $\sqrt{2}$ were rational, $\mathbb{Q}$ would have no holes (at least not this one), and
    the real numbers might never have been invented. But $\sqrt{2}$ <em>isn't</em> rational, and
    $\mathbb{Q}$ is riddled with gaps. The entire apparatus of analysis — limits, continuity,
    the derivative, the integral, every theorem in calculus — is built on $\mathbb{R}$, which
    exists precisely because $\mathbb{Q}$ is incomplete. This one proof is the crack in the
    foundation that forced mathematics to build a new one.
