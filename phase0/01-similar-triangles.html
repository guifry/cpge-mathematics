<h1>Similar Triangles and Measurement</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Phase 0 — The Foundations</div>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The Problem</div>
  <p>
    It is roughly 600 BC. Thales of Miletus stands in the Egyptian desert, looking up at the Great Pyramid of Giza.
    The pyramid is about 2,000 years old at this point. It is enormous. He wants to know its height.
  </p>
  <p>
    He cannot climb it. He has no rope long enough. He has no instrument that can measure vertical distances
    at that scale. What he does have: his own body (whose height he knows), the sun, and the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    He notices something. The sun casts his shadow on the ground, and it also casts the pyramid's shadow.
    Both shadows point the same direction, because the light comes from the same source at the same angle.
    His body and its shadow form a right triangle. The pyramid and its shadow form another right triangle.
    The sun's angle above the horizon is the same for both.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can he use his shadow to find the height of the pyramid?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The answer is yes, and the reason it works is one of the most important facts in all of geometry.
  But it isn't obvious. It requires a theorem.
</p>

<h2>1. What does "same shape" mean?</h2>

<p>
  Look at Thales' two triangles. One is small (him and his shadow), one is vast (the pyramid and its shadow).
  They look like the same shape at different scales. But what precisely does "same shape" mean for triangles?
</p>

<p>
  A triangle has three angles and three sides. Two triangles have the <strong>same shape</strong> if their
  three angles match up: the first triangle's angles are the same as the second triangle's angles, in
  corresponding order. We call such triangles <strong>similar</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Notation: if triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $DEF$, we write $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$.
  The order matters &mdash; it tells you which angles correspond. $A$ matches $D$, $B$ matches $E$, $C$ matches $F$.
</p>

<p>
  In Thales' case, both triangles are right triangles (the pyramid and the person both stand vertically on flat ground),
  and both share the sun's elevation angle. Since two of the three angles match, and angles in any triangle
  sum to $180°$, the third must match too. So the triangles are similar.
</p>

<p>
  But here is the question that matters: <strong>does "same angles" actually guarantee that the sides scale proportionally?</strong>
  Thales needs it to. His whole method depends on it. Let us state what he needs as a theorem, then prove it.
</p>

<h2>2. The theorem</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Similar Triangles</div>
  <p>
    If two triangles have equal corresponding angles (i.e. they are similar), then their corresponding
    sides are proportional. That is, if $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, with
    $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, $\angle C = \angle F$, then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}$$
  </div>
  <p>
    This common ratio is called the <strong>scale factor</strong>, often written $k$.
    Conversely, if the sides are proportional, the angles are equal.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Let us unpack what "proportional" means with numbers. Suppose Thales is 1.8 m tall and casts a shadow
  of 2.4 m. The pyramid casts a shadow of 210 m (measured from the centre of its base to the tip of the shadow).
  If the theorem holds, then:
</p>

<div class="display-math">
  $$\frac{\text{Thales' height}}{\text{pyramid's height}} = \frac{\text{Thales' shadow}}{\text{pyramid's shadow}}$$
</div>

<p>
  Every pair of corresponding sides shares the same ratio $k$. That is the whole content of the theorem.
  It means knowing three of the four quantities is enough to find the fourth.
</p>

<h2>3. Why does this work? &mdash; The proof</h2>

<p>
  The proof strategy goes back to Euclid (<em>Elements</em>, Book VI, Proposition 2). The key idea is:
  a line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle cuts the other two sides proportionally.
  This is sometimes called the <strong>intercept theorem</strong>, or, fittingly, <strong>Thales' theorem</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Step 1 &mdash; The intercept theorem</h3>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Lemma &mdash; Intercept Theorem</div>
  <p>
    In triangle $ABC$, let $D$ be a point on side $AB$ and $E$ a point on side $AC$, such that $DE \parallel BC$.
    Then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC}$$
  </div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof sketch</div>
  <p>
    Draw $DE$ parallel to $BC$, hitting $AB$ at $D$ and $AC$ at $E$. Consider triangles $ADE$ and $ABC$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because $DE \parallel BC$, the angle $\angle ADE$ equals $\angle ABC$ (corresponding angles formed by
    a transversal cutting parallel lines). Similarly, $\angle AED = \angle ACB$. Angle $A$ is shared.
    So $\triangle ADE$ has the same three angles as $\triangle ABC$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now for the proportionality. Draw the height from $A$ perpendicular to $BC$, and call its length $h$.
    This height also passes through the line $DE$ (since $DE$ is parallel to $BC$), hitting $DE$ at some point,
    with the portion from $A$ to $DE$ being $h'$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h$. The area of $\triangle ADE$ is $\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot DE \cdot h'$.
    But we can also express these areas using the sides $AB$ and $AD$: triangles $ADE$ and $DBC$ share the base $DE$ and $BC$
    on parallel lines, so their area ratio equals the ratio of their heights from $A$, which equals $\frac{AD}{AB}$.
  </p>
  <p>
    By carefully equating the two ways of computing the area ratio (via bases $DE/BC$ and via heights $h'/h$
    and via side ratios $AD/AB$), you get:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC}$$
  </div>
  <p>
    Euclid's original proof uses the theory of equal-area parallelograms rather than our algebraic area
    formula, but the underlying logic is the same: parallel lines create equal ratios.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&marker;</div>
</div>

<h3>Step 2 &mdash; From the lemma to the theorem</h3>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof of the Similar Triangles theorem</div>
  <p>
    Take two triangles with equal corresponding angles: $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$,
    with $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, $\angle C = \angle F$.
  </p>
  <p>
    We want to show $\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Construction.</strong> Place $\triangle DEF$ inside $\triangle ABC$ by
    marking a point $D'$ on $AB$ such that $AD' = DE$, and a point $F'$ on $AC$ such that $AF' = DF$.
    Since $\angle A = \angle D$ and we matched two sides, the triangle $\triangle AD'F'$ is congruent to
    $\triangle DEF$ (by side-angle-side).
  </p>
  <p>
    So $\angle AD'F' = \angle DEF = \angle ABC$ (since $\angle B = \angle E$). This means $D'F' \parallel BC$
    (corresponding angles equal implies parallel lines).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now apply the intercept theorem to triangle $ABC$ with the parallel line $D'F'$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{AD'}{AB} = \frac{AF'}{AC} = \frac{D'F'}{BC}$$
  </div>
  <p>
    But $AD' = DE$, $AF' = DF$, and $D'F' = EF$ (from the congruence). Substituting:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">
    $$\frac{DE}{AB} = \frac{DF}{AC} = \frac{EF}{BC}$$
  </div>
  <p>
    Flip the fractions and you have $\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{AC}{DF} = \frac{BC}{EF}$. Done.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&marker;</div>
</div>

<p>
  Notice where the parallel postulate enters. The step "corresponding angles equal implies parallel lines"
  is equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate. In non-Euclidean geometry (on a sphere, say), this theorem
  breaks down &mdash; and we will revisit that in the "what breaks" section below.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    The story of Thales and the pyramid is told by Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius.
    Whether Thales used exactly this method, or waited until his shadow was the same length as his height
    (reducing the problem to a 1:1 ratio), is debated. Either way, the core insight is the same:
    same sun angle, same shape, proportional sides.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thales is often credited as the first person to prove a geometric theorem at all, rather than
    just asserting patterns. The leap from "this seems to work" to "here is why it must work"
    is arguably the birth of mathematics as a deductive discipline.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>4. Solving Thales' problem</h2>

<p>
  Now we can finish the calculation. Let $h$ be the pyramid's height (unknown). The two right triangles
  share the sun's elevation angle $\theta$. Their corresponding sides are proportional:
</p>

<div class="display-math">
  $$\frac{\text{Thales' height}}{\text{Thales' shadow}} = \frac{\text{pyramid's height}}{\text{pyramid's shadow}}$$
</div>

<p>
  With our numbers: Thales' height $= 1.8$ m, his shadow $= 2.4$ m, the pyramid's shadow $= 210$ m
  (measured from the centre of the base to the tip of the shadow, since the pyramid's "height" rises from its centre).
</p>

<div class="display-math">
  $$\frac{1.8}{2.4} = \frac{h}{210}$$
</div>

<div class="display-math">
  $$h = 210 \times \frac{1.8}{2.4} = 210 \times 0.75 = 157.5 \text{ m}$$
</div>

<p>
  The actual height of the Great Pyramid (when intact) was about 146 m. Given the rough measurements available
  to someone standing in the desert with no tape measure, this is remarkably close. The method works.
</p>

<h2>5. The scale factor</h2>

<p>
  It is worth pausing on what the theorem gives us. The ratio
</p>

<div class="display-math">
  $$k = \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}$$
</div>

<p>
  is a single number &mdash; the <strong>scale factor</strong>. It tells you: "the second triangle is $k$ times
  larger than the first." Every length in the bigger triangle is exactly $k$ times the corresponding length
  in the smaller one. Not some lengths. All of them. That is the force of the theorem.
</p>

<p>
  If $k = 1$, the triangles are the same size &mdash; they are <strong>congruent</strong>, not just similar.
  Similarity is the more general idea; congruence is the special case where the scale factor is 1.
</p>

<h2>6. Why this matters for everything that follows</h2>

<p>
  Here is the punchline, and the reason this page exists at the start of a trigonometry course:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Trigonometry is similar triangles.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  When you learn that $\sin(30°) = 0.5$, what that statement means is: in <em>every</em> right triangle
  with a $30°$ angle, the ratio of the side opposite that angle to the hypotenuse is $0.5$. Not in one
  specific triangle. In all of them. A tiny triangle drawn on a napkin and a vast triangle spanning a valley
  &mdash; both give $\text{opposite}/\text{hypotenuse} = 0.5$.
</p>

<p>
  This only works because of the similar triangles theorem. All right triangles with a $30°$ angle also
  have a $60°$ angle (since $180° - 90° - 30° = 60°$). So they all have the same three angles. So they
  are all similar. So their sides are all proportional. So the ratio $\text{opposite}/\text{hypotenuse}$
  is the same number regardless of which triangle you pick.
</p>

<p>
  That number &mdash; that ratio determined entirely by the angle &mdash; is what we call the <em>sine</em> of the angle.
  And the cosine. And the tangent. Every trigonometric function is, at its core, a statement about ratios
  in similar right triangles.
</p>

<p>
  Without the similar triangles theorem, you could not define $\sin(\theta)$ as a function of the angle alone.
  The ratio would depend on which triangle you happened to be looking at. Trigonometry would not exist.
</p>

<h2>7. What breaks without this</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>If same angles did not guarantee proportional sides</strong>, then:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Thales' method fails. Two right triangles sharing the sun's angle could have completely
      different height-to-shadow ratios. Knowing your own ratio tells you nothing about the pyramid's.
    </li>
    <li>
      $\sin(\theta)$ is not well-defined. The ratio $\text{opposite}/\text{hypotenuse}$ would vary
      from triangle to triangle, even with the same angle. There would be no single number to call
      "the sine of 30 degrees."
    </li>
    <li>
      Surveying, navigation, astronomy, engineering &mdash; anything that infers a distance from an angle
      and a known length &mdash; breaks down.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>This actually happens on curved surfaces.</strong> On a sphere, you can draw two triangles
    with the same three angles but different side ratios. The surface of the Earth is curved, so if you
    draw a very large "triangle" (say, pole to equator to equator and back), the angles sum to more than
    $180°$, and the proportionality of flat geometry does not hold. The similar triangles theorem is a
    theorem of flat (Euclidean) geometry. It depends on the parallel postulate. On a sphere, parallels
    do not exist and the theorem fails.
  </p>
  <p>
    For small regions of the Earth's surface, the curvature is negligible and flat geometry works fine.
    That is why Thales' method works in a desert but would fail if the "triangle" spanned continents.
