<h1>Diophantine Equations</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 1 — Number Theory, Page 7</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Diophantus of Alexandria (3rd century AD) studied equations where only integer solutions
    count. The equation $3x + 5y = 1$ has the real solution $x = 0$, $y = 0.2$ — but that's
    no good if $x$ and $y$ must be whole numbers. It also has $x = 2$, $y = -1$ — that works.
  </p>
  <p>
    The question: when does an equation have integer solutions, how do you find them, and how
    many are there? This is a fundamentally different challenge from real-valued algebra. Over
    $\mathbb{R}$, a single linear equation in two unknowns always has infinitely many solutions
    (a line). Over $\mathbb{Z}$, it might have none at all.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The linear Diophantine equation</h2>

<p>
  A <strong>linear Diophantine equation</strong> is an equation of the form
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$ax + by = c$$</div>
<p>
  where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers and we seek integer solutions $(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$.
  The word "linear" means the unknowns appear to the first power only. The word "Diophantine"
  means we demand integer solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Over $\mathbb{R}$, this equation describes a line, and any point on that line is a solution.
  Over $\mathbb{Z}$, we only want the <em>lattice points</em> — the points with integer
  coordinates that happen to lie on that line. There might be none, or infinitely many, but
  never just a finite number (we'll see why shortly).
</p>

<h2>2. When do solutions exist?</h2>

<p>
  The answer turns out to be a clean divisibility condition — exactly the kind of criterion
  that Bezout's identity (page 1) was built for.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Existence criterion)</div>
  <p>
    The equation $ax + by = c$ has integer solutions if and only if $\gcd(a, b) \mid c$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Necessity ($\Rightarrow$).</strong>
    Suppose $(x_0, y_0)$ is an integer solution, so $ax_0 + by_0 = c$. Let $d = \gcd(a, b)$.
    Since $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$, we have $d \mid (ax_0 + by_0)$, so $d \mid c$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sufficiency ($\Leftarrow$).</strong>
    Suppose $d \mid c$. By Bezout's identity (page 1), there exist integers $u, v$ with
    $au + bv = d$. Multiply both sides by $c/d$ (which is an integer since $d \mid c$):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a\!\left(\frac{c}{d} u\right) + b\!\left(\frac{c}{d} v\right) = c$$</div>
  <p>
    So $(x_0, y_0) = (cu/d, \, cv/d)$ is an integer solution.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>Example.</strong> Consider $6x + 10y = 8$. We have $\gcd(6, 10) = 2$ and $2 \mid 8$,
  so solutions exist. But $6x + 10y = 7$ has <em>no</em> solutions, because $2 \nmid 7$. No
  amount of searching will find one — the divisibility structure of the integers prohibits it.
</p>

<h2>3. Finding all solutions</h2>

<p>
  The existence theorem tells us <em>whether</em> solutions exist. The next theorem tells us
  <em>what they all look like</em>. The answer is a one-parameter family — once you have one
  solution, you get all of them by sliding along the line in steps dictated by $a$ and $b$.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (General solution)</div>
  <p>
    If $(x_0, y_0)$ is one particular solution of $ax + by = c$, and $d = \gcd(a, b)$,
    then <strong>all</strong> integer solutions are given by
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}\,t, \qquad y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}\,t \qquad (t \in \mathbb{Z})$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. These are indeed solutions.</strong>
    Substitute into $ax + by$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a\!\left(x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t\right) + b\!\left(y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t\right) = ax_0 + by_0 + \frac{ab}{d}t - \frac{ab}{d}t = c$$</div>
  <p>
    So every $(x_0 + (b/d)t, \; y_0 - (a/d)t)$ is a solution, for any $t \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. These are all solutions.</strong>
    Suppose $(x_1, y_1)$ is any other integer solution. Then $ax_1 + by_1 = c$ and
    $ax_0 + by_0 = c$. Subtract:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a(x_1 - x_0) + b(y_1 - y_0) = 0$$</div>
  <p>
    Divide through by $d$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{a}{d}(x_1 - x_0) = -\frac{b}{d}(y_1 - y_0)$$</div>
  <p>
    Now $\gcd(a/d, \, b/d) = 1$ (we divided out the full GCD). So $(b/d) \mid (x_1 - x_0)$
    by Gauss's lemma (page 2): since $b/d$ divides the product $(a/d)(x_1 - x_0)$ and is
    coprime to $a/d$, it must divide $x_1 - x_0$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Write $x_1 - x_0 = (b/d)t$ for some integer $t$. Then from the equation above,
    $(a/d)(b/d)t = -(b/d)(y_1 - y_0)$, so $y_1 - y_0 = -(a/d)t$. This gives $x_1 = x_0 + (b/d)t$
    and $y_1 = y_0 - (a/d)t$, which is exactly the parametric family.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  The key insight: solutions form an infinite lattice along the line, spaced at intervals
  of $(b/d, -a/d)$. There are either zero solutions (when $d \nmid c$) or infinitely many
  (when $d \mid c$). Never a finite nonzero number.
</p>

<h2>4. Worked example</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Solve $252x + 105y = 21$.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 1: check existence.</strong> Run the Euclidean algorithm (page 1):
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$252 = 2 \times 105 + 42$$</div>
<div class="display-math">$$105 = 2 \times 42 + 21$$</div>
<div class="display-math">$$42 = 2 \times 21 + 0$$</div>
<p>
  So $\gcd(252, 105) = 21$. Since $21 \mid 21$, solutions exist.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: find one solution via back-substitution.</strong> From the algorithm:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$21 = 105 - 2 \times 42 = 105 - 2(252 - 2 \times 105) = 5 \times 105 - 2 \times 252$$</div>
<p>
  So $252 \times (-2) + 105 \times 5 = 21$. One solution is $(x_0, y_0) = (-2, 5)$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 3: write the general solution.</strong> With $d = 21$, $b/d = 105/21 = 5$,
  $a/d = 252/21 = 12$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$x = -2 + 5t, \qquad y = 5 - 12t \qquad (t \in \mathbb{Z})$$</div>

<p>
  <strong>Step 4: find specific solutions.</strong> A few values:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>$t$</th><th>$x$</th><th>$y$</th></tr>
  <tr><td>$-1$</td><td>$-7$</td><td>$17$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$-2$</td><td>$5$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$3$</td><td>$-7$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$2$</td><td>$8$</td><td>$-19$</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The smallest positive $x$ is $x = 3$ (at $t = 1$), giving $(3, -7)$.
  Check: $252 \times 3 + 105 \times (-7) = 756 - 735 = 21$. Correct.
</p>

<h2>5. Pythagorean triples</h2>

<p>
  Linear Diophantine equations are the simplest case. What about nonlinear ones? The most
  famous is
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$</div>
<p>
  where we seek positive integer solutions $(a, b, c)$. These are called <strong>Pythagorean
  triples</strong> — they correspond to right triangles with integer side lengths. You know
  $(3, 4, 5)$ and $(5, 12, 13)$. Are there infinitely many? Can we find them all?
</p>

<p>
  A triple is <strong>primitive</strong> if $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. Every Pythagorean triple is
  a multiple of a primitive one, so it suffices to classify the primitive triples.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Parametrisation of primitive Pythagorean triples)</div>
  <p>
    Every primitive Pythagorean triple (with $b$ even) is of the form
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a = m^2 - n^2, \qquad b = 2mn, \qquad c = m^2 + n^2$$</div>
  <p>
    where $m > n > 0$, $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, and $m - n$ is odd.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof (derivation)</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1: parity.</strong> In a primitive triple, $a$ and $b$ cannot both be even
    (then $2 \mid \gcd(a, b, c)$). They cannot both be odd either: if $a$ and $b$ are both
    odd, then $a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \pmod{4}$, but every perfect square is $\equiv 0$
    or $1 \pmod{4}$, so $c^2 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ — contradiction. So exactly one of $a, b$
    is even. Assume $b$ is even (relabelling if needed).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2: factorise.</strong> Since $b$ is even, write $b = 2k$. Then
    $c^2 - a^2 = b^2 = 4k^2$, so $(c - a)(c + a) = 4k^2$. Since $a$ and $c$ are both odd,
    $c - a$ and $c + a$ are both even. Write $c - a = 2s$ and $c + a = 2r$ where $r > s > 0$.
    Then $4sr = 4k^2$, so $sr = k^2$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3: $\gcd(r, s) = 1$.</strong> Any common divisor of $r$ and $s$ divides
    $r + s = c$ and $r - s = a$, hence divides $\gcd(a, c)$. But any prime $p \mid \gcd(a, c)$
    also divides $c^2 - a^2 = b^2$, so $p \mid b$, contradicting $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$.
    Therefore $\gcd(r, s) = 1$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4: both factors are perfect squares.</strong> We have $sr = k^2$ with
    $\gcd(s, r) = 1$. By unique factorisation (page 2), since the product is a perfect
    square and the factors are coprime, each factor must individually be a perfect square.
    Write $s = n^2$ and $r = m^2$ for positive integers $m > n$ with $\gcd(m, n) = 1$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5: extract $a, b, c$.</strong> From $c - a = 2n^2$ and $c + a = 2m^2$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a = m^2 - n^2, \qquad c = m^2 + n^2, \qquad b = 2k = 2mn$$</div>
  <p>
    (since $k^2 = sr = m^2 n^2$, so $k = mn$). Finally, $m - n$ must be odd: if $m$ and $n$
    had the same parity, then $a = m^2 - n^2 = (m-n)(m+n)$ would be even (both factors even),
    contradicting $a$ odd.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, any $m > n > 0$ with $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ and $m - n$ odd produces a primitive
    triple. (Checking: $a^2 + b^2 = (m^2 - n^2)^2 + 4m^2n^2 = m^4 - 2m^2n^2 + n^4 + 4m^2n^2
    = m^4 + 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = (m^2 + n^2)^2 = c^2$.)
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  A few primitive triples from this formula:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>$m$</th><th>$n$</th><th>$a$</th><th>$b$</th><th>$c$</th></tr>
  <tr><td>$2$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$3$</td><td>$4$</td><td>$5$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$3$</td><td>$2$</td><td>$5$</td><td>$12$</td><td>$13$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$4$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$15$</td><td>$8$</td><td>$17$</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$4$</td><td>$3$</td><td>$7$</td><td>$24$</td><td>$25$</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  This connects back to Phase 0: the Pythagorean theorem tells us these triples exist
  geometrically, and number theory classifies them completely. Every right triangle with
  integer sides comes from a pair $(m, n)$.
</p>

<h2>6. Phase 1 recap</h2>

<p>
  This completes Phase 1. Here is what you now have from number theory:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Division algorithm and Euclidean algorithm</strong> (page 1) — computing GCDs efficiently</li>
  <li><strong>Bezout's identity</strong> (page 1) — $\gcd(a, b)$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$</li>
  <li><strong>Primes and unique factorisation</strong> (page 2) — the fundamental theorem of arithmetic</li>
  <li><strong>Modular arithmetic and inverses</strong> (page 3) — arithmetic modulo $n$, when inverses exist</li>
  <li><strong>Fermat's little theorem</strong> (page 4) — $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$</li>
  <li><strong>Euler's totient and theorem</strong> (page 5) — $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$</li>
  <li><strong>Chinese Remainder Theorem</strong> (page 6) — solving systems of congruences</li>
  <li><strong>Diophantine equations</strong> (this page) — integer solutions to $ax + by = c$, Pythagorean triples</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These tools reappear throughout mathematics: Bezout and CRT in algebra (Phase 10),
  modular arithmetic in cryptography, Fermat and Euler in computational number theory.
  The Pythagorean triple parametrisation is a first taste of how number theory classifies
  integer solutions to polynomial equations — a thread that leads to elliptic curves and
  ultimately to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Looking ahead.</strong> Phase 2 takes a completely different direction — from the
  discrete world of integers to the continuous world of real numbers. We'll start with the
  completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ (Phase 0, page 3 showed us why $\mathbb{Q}$ is broken), then
  build sequences, limits, and convergence from scratch.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Diophantus of Alexandria</strong> (circa 250 AD) authored the <em>Arithmetica</em>,
    a collection of 130 problems asking for rational (not just integer) solutions to polynomial
    equations. Despite this, the tradition named after him focuses on integer solutions.
    Only six of the original thirteen books survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most consequential margin note in mathematical history was written in a copy of
    <em>Arithmetica</em>. Around 1637, Pierre de Fermat scribbled next to the equation
    $x^n + y^n = z^n$: "I have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this proposition,
    which this margin is too narrow to contain." The claim — that there are no positive
    integer solutions for $n \geq 3$ — became <strong>Fermat's Last Theorem</strong>, and
    resisted proof for 358 years until Andrew Wiles settled it in 1995 using the modularity
    theorem for elliptic curves. Diophantus could not have imagined the depth of the subject
    his textbook problems would spawn.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>If $\gcd(a, b) \nmid c$:</strong> the equation $ax + by = c$ is literally
    impossible. This isn't "we haven't looked hard enough" — the divisibility structure of
    the integers prohibits any solution. Every integer combination of $a$ and $b$ is a
    multiple of $\gcd(a, b)$, and $c$ isn't one. The sharpest form of "no solution exists."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If we allow rationals instead of integers:</strong> the problem becomes trivial.
    $ax + by = c$ always has rational solutions (just set $x = c/a$, $y = 0$, assuming $a \neq 0$).
    Similarly, Pythagorean triples over $\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to rational points on the
    unit circle $X^2 + Y^2 = 1$, which are easy to parametrise (draw a line from $(-1, 0)$
    with rational slope). The integer constraint is what creates the deep structure.
    Integers are harder than rationals.
