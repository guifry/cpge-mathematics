<h1>Prime Numbers and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 1 — Number Theory and Arithmetic, Page 2</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    The Pythagoreans and Euclid asked: what are the <strong>atoms of arithmetic</strong>?
    You can break 12 into $2 \times 2 \times 3$. You can break 30 into $2 \times 3 \times 5$.
    But 7 cannot be broken down further. These irreducible numbers — <em>primes</em> — are the
    building blocks from which every other number is assembled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two questions follow immediately. First: are there infinitely many primes, or do they
    eventually run out? Second: when you break a number into primes, is the result always
    the same? That is — does every number have a <em>unique</em> factorisation?
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Primes and composites</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition</div>
  <p>
    A <strong>prime number</strong> is an integer $p > 1$ whose only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$ itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <strong>composite number</strong> is a positive integer $> 1$ that is not prime — that is,
    it has a positive divisor other than $1$ and itself.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The first few primes: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, \ldots$ Note that $2$ is the
  only even prime — every other even number is divisible by $2$ and hence composite.
</p>

<p>
  Why is $1$ <strong>not</strong> prime? This is a convention, but a deeply motivated one.
  If $1$ were prime, then $6 = 2 \times 3 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 3 = \cdots$
  and factorisation would never be unique — you could always throw in more copies of $1$.
  Excluding $1$ from the primes is precisely what makes the Fundamental Theorem (section 5)
  work. We'll return to this in the break-box.
</p>

<h2>2. The Sieve of Eratosthenes</h2>

<p>
  Around 240 BC, <strong>Eratosthenes of Cyrene</strong> devised an algorithm to find all primes
  up to a given bound $n$. Write out all integers from $2$ to $n$. Start with the smallest
  unmarked number ($2$) — it's prime. Cross out all its multiples ($4, 6, 8, \ldots$). Move to
  the next unmarked number ($3$) — it's prime. Cross out its multiples ($6, 9, 12, \ldots$).
  Continue. Every number that survives the sieve is prime.
</p>

<p>
  Let's sieve up to $30$. Start with $2$: cross out $4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30$.
  Next unmarked: $3$. Cross out $9, 15, 21, 27$ (the others were already crossed).
  Next unmarked: $5$. Cross out $25$.
  Next unmarked: $7$. Its first uncrossed multiple would be $49 > 30$, so we stop.
</p>

<p>
  Survivors: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29$. These are exactly the primes up to $30$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why stop at $\sqrt{n}$?</strong> Suppose $n$ is composite, so $n = ab$ with $1 < a \leq b < n$.
  If both $a > \sqrt{n}$ and $b > \sqrt{n}$, then $ab > \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} = n$,
  contradicting $ab = n$. So at least one factor satisfies $a \leq \sqrt{n}$. This means every
  composite number $\leq n$ has a prime factor $\leq \sqrt{n}$. Once you've sieved with all
  primes up to $\sqrt{n}$, every surviving number is prime. For $n = 30$, we have
  $\sqrt{30} \approx 5.47$, so sieving with $2, 3, 5$ suffices.
</p>

<h2>3. Euclid's lemma</h2>

<p>
  This is the <em>key lemma</em> — the result on which the uniqueness of prime factorisation
  depends. Everything in this page builds towards it or follows from it.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Euclid's Lemma</div>
  <p>
    If $p$ is prime and $p \mid ab$, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  In words: a prime that divides a product must divide at least one of the factors. This is
  <em>not</em> true for composite numbers — $6 \mid 4 \times 9$ but $6 \nmid 4$ and $6 \nmid 9$.
  The lemma is telling you something deep about what it means to be prime.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Suppose $p \mid ab$ and $p \nmid a$. We need to show $p \mid b$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Since $p$ is prime, its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$.
    Since $p \nmid a$, the greatest common divisor $\gcd(p, a)$ cannot be $p$. So
    $\gcd(p, a) = 1$ — that is, $p$ and $a$ are coprime.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> By Bézout's identity (proved on page 01), there exist integers
    $x, y$ such that
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$px + ay = 1$$</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Multiply both sides by $b$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$pbx + aby = b$$</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5.</strong> Now look at the left side. The term $pbx$ is divisible by $p$
    (it has $p$ as a factor). The term $aby$ is divisible by $p$ because $p \mid ab$ by
    hypothesis. Since $p$ divides both terms, $p$ divides their sum, which is $b$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore $p \mid b$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  The proof is short, but notice how much is packed into it. The entire argument pivots on
  Bézout's identity — without it, we'd have no way to connect "$p$ and $a$ are coprime" to
  a divisibility statement about $b$. This is why we needed page 01 first.
</p>

<h2>4. Infinitely many primes</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Euclid, Elements IX.20)</div>
  <p>
    There are infinitely many prime numbers.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Suppose, for contradiction, that there are only finitely many
    primes. List them all: $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Form the number
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$N = p_1 \, p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$$</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> We ask: is $N$ divisible by any prime on our list? Take any $p_i$.
    Since $p_i$ divides the product $p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n$, dividing $N$ by $p_i$ gives a
    remainder of $1$. So $p_i \nmid N$ for every $i$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> But $N > 1$, so $N$ is either prime itself or has a prime factor.
    In either case, there exists a prime that divides $N$ — and that prime is not on our list
    (since no $p_i$ divides $N$). This contradicts the assumption that our list contained
    <em>all</em> primes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore the primes are infinite.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  A common misreading: "$N$ itself is prime." That's not what the proof says. $N$ might be
  prime, or it might be composite — but either way, it produces a prime not on the list.
  For example, $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 + 1 = 30031 = 59 \times 509$.
  Neither $59$ nor $509$ was on the original list. The proof works perfectly.
</p>

<h2>5. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</div>
  <p>
    Every integer $n > 1$ can be written as a product of prime numbers
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$n = p_1^{a_1} \, p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}$$</div>
  <p>
    and this factorisation is <strong>unique</strong> up to the order of the factors.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Two claims here: <em>existence</em> (every number <em>has</em> a prime factorisation) and
  <em>uniqueness</em> (there's only <em>one</em> such factorisation). They require separate proofs.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof of existence (by strong induction)</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Base case.</strong> $n = 2$ is prime, so its factorisation is just $2$. Done.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Inductive step.</strong> Let $n > 2$. Assume every integer $m$ with $2 \leq m < n$
    has a prime factorisation (this is <em>strong</em> induction — we assume it for all
    predecessors, not just $n - 1$).
  </p>

  <p>
    If $n$ is prime, its factorisation is just $n$ itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    If $n$ is composite, then $n = ab$ for some integers with $1 < a, b < n$. By the induction
    hypothesis, both $a$ and $b$ have prime factorisations. Multiplying them gives a prime
    factorisation of $n$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof of uniqueness (using Euclid's lemma)</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Suppose, for contradiction, that some integer $n > 1$ has two
    different prime factorisations:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$n = p_1 \, p_2 \cdots p_r = q_1 \, q_2 \cdots q_s$$</div>
  <p>
    where all $p_i$ and $q_j$ are prime (listed with repetition, not necessarily distinct).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Consider $p_1$. Since $p_1 \mid n = q_1 \, q_2 \cdots q_s$, we can
    apply Euclid's lemma. First: $p_1 \mid q_1 \cdot (q_2 \cdots q_s)$, so either $p_1 \mid q_1$
    or $p_1 \mid q_2 \cdots q_s$. If the latter, apply the lemma again. Repeating, we eventually
    find some $q_j$ such that $p_1 \mid q_j$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> Since $q_j$ is prime, its only positive divisors are $1$ and $q_j$.
    Since $p_1 > 1$, we must have $p_1 = q_j$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Cancel $p_1 = q_j$ from both sides:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$p_2 \cdots p_r = q_1 \cdots q_{j-1} \, q_{j+1} \cdots q_s$$</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5.</strong> Repeat: match $p_2$ with some $q$, cancel, and continue. Each step
    removes one prime from each side. If $r = s$, we eventually reach $1 = 1$ and every $p_i$
    has been matched to a $q_j$ — the two factorisations are the same (up to reordering).
  </p>

  <p>
    If $r \neq s$, say $r < s$, then after cancelling all $p_i$ we'd have
    $1 = q_{?} \cdots q_{?}$, a product of primes equalling $1$. But every prime is $> 1$,
    so a product of primes is $> 1$. Contradiction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore the factorisation is unique up to order.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<h2>6. Application: a cleaner proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational</h2>

<p>
  In Phase 0, page 3, we proved $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational using an even/odd parity argument.
  The Fundamental Theorem gives a slicker proof.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof (via FTA)</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Suppose $\sqrt{2} = p/q$ with $p, q$ positive integers.
    Then $p^2 = 2q^2$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> By the Fundamental Theorem, write $p$ and $q$ in their prime
    factorisations. When you square a number, every prime exponent doubles. So the exponent
    of $2$ in the factorisation of $p^2$ is <em>even</em>, and the exponent of $2$ in the
    factorisation of $q^2$ is also <em>even</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> But $2q^2$ has the factorisation of $q^2$ with one extra factor
    of $2$. So the exponent of $2$ in $2q^2$ is $\text{even} + 1 = \text{odd}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> We have $p^2 = 2q^2$, but the left side has an even exponent of
    $2$ and the right side has an odd exponent of $2$. This contradicts the uniqueness of prime
    factorisation.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">∎</div>
</div>

<p>
  This is the same result, but the mechanism is sharper. Instead of chasing even/odd through
  a chain of substitutions, we simply count prime factors and observe a parity mismatch.
  The FTA does the heavy lifting.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Euclid's <em>Elements</em>, Books VII–IX (~300 BC), contain most of this page's results.
    The infinity of primes is Proposition 20 of Book IX — one of the most celebrated results in
    all of mathematics. Euclid's lemma appears as Proposition 30 of Book VII, though stated
    differently (in terms of "measuring" rather than divisibility).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic was <em>used</em> by everyone from Euclid onwards —
    it was considered self-evident. But the first <em>rigorous proof</em> came from Gauss in
    <em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em> (1801), over two thousand years later. The gap between
    "obvious" and "proved" was extraordinary. Gauss recognised that uniqueness requires a
    careful argument — specifically, it requires Euclid's lemma, which itself requires
    Bézout's identity. The chain of dependencies is not trivial.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>If 1 were prime.</strong> Then $6 = 2 \times 3 = 1 \times 2 \times 3
    = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 3 = \cdots$ — you could pad any factorisation with arbitrarily
    many copies of $1$. Uniqueness would be impossible. Excluding $1$ from the primes is not
    arbitrary; it is exactly the convention needed to make the FTA true.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If we leave $\mathbb{Z}$.</strong> Consider the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$
    (numbers of the form $a + b\sqrt{-5}$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$). In this ring:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$6 = 2 \times 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})$$</div>
  <p>
    These are two genuinely different factorisations into irreducible elements — $2$, $3$,
    $1 + \sqrt{-5}$, and $1 - \sqrt{-5}$ are all irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, but
    none of them divides the others. Unique factorisation <em>fails</em>. It is a special
    property of $\mathbb{Z}$, not something you get for free in every number system. Recovering
    unique factorisation in such rings led Dedekind to invent <em>ideals</em> — one of the
    foundational concepts of modern algebra.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without Euclid's lemma.</strong> The existence proof (strong induction) goes through
    in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ just fine — every element has <em>some</em> factorisation into
    irreducibles. What fails is <em>uniqueness</em>, because Euclid's lemma fails: $2$ divides
    $(1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}) = 6$ but $2$ divides neither factor. The lemma is not a
    technicality — it is the entire reason uniqueness holds in $\mathbb{Z}$.
