<h1>Divisibility and the Euclidean Algorithm</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 1 — Number Theory, Page 1</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    You have 1230 soldiers and want to arrange them in equal rows. How many per row?
    Which arrangements work? 10 rows of 123? 6 rows of 205? 7 rows of... something?
    Try dividing 1230 by 7 and you get 175 with 5 left over. Seven doesn't work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Egyptians and Babylonians faced this constantly: dividing land into equal plots,
    distributing grain among households, fitting days into calendar cycles. The question
    is ancient and concrete: <strong>when does one number divide another evenly, and what
    happens when it doesn't?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The division algorithm</h2>

<p>
  Before we can talk about divisibility, we need a precise statement of what happens when
  you divide one integer by another. You get a quotient and a remainder, and both are
  <em>unique</em>. This is so fundamental it gets its own name.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Division algorithm)</div>
  <p>
    For any integers $a$ and $b$ with $b > 0$, there exist <strong>unique</strong> integers
    $q$ (the <strong>quotient</strong>) and $r$ (the <strong>remainder</strong>) such that
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a = bq + r \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq r < b.$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  Unpack this. The theorem says two things: these integers <em>exist</em>, and they are the
  <em>only</em> pair that works. The condition $0 \leq r < b$ is what pins them down. Without
  it, you could write $17 = 5 \cdot 2 + 7$ or $17 = 5 \cdot 4 + (-3)$ — multiple representations.
  Forcing $r$ into $\{0, 1, \ldots, b-1\}$ makes the decomposition unique.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Existence.</strong> Consider the set $S = \{a - bk : k \in \mathbb{Z},\; a - bk \geq 0\}$.
    This is the set of all non-negative values you can get by subtracting multiples of $b$ from $a$.
    The set $S$ is non-empty: if $a \geq 0$, take $k = 0$ to get $a \in S$; if $a < 0$, take
    $k = a$ (so $a - ba = a(1 - b) \geq 0$ since $b \geq 1$ and $a < 0$).
  </p>
  <p>
    Since $S$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers, the <strong>well-ordering principle</strong>
    guarantees it has a smallest element. Call it $r = a - bq$ for the corresponding $k = q$. By
    construction, $r \geq 0$.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need $r < b$. Suppose for contradiction that $r \geq b$. Then $r - b = a - bq - b = a - b(q+1) \geq 0$,
    so $r - b \in S$. But $r - b < r$, contradicting the fact that $r$ is the smallest element of $S$.
    Therefore $r < b$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Uniqueness.</strong> Suppose $a = bq_1 + r_1$ and $a = bq_2 + r_2$ with
    $0 \leq r_1, r_2 < b$. Then $bq_1 + r_1 = bq_2 + r_2$, so $b(q_1 - q_2) = r_2 - r_1$.
    The left side is a multiple of $b$. The right side satisfies $|r_2 - r_1| < b$ (since both
    remainders lie in $\{0, \ldots, b-1\}$). The only multiple of $b$ with absolute value less
    than $b$ is $0$. So $r_1 = r_2$ and $q_1 = q_2$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The key observation: $b$ <strong>divides</strong> $a$ evenly precisely when $r = 0$, i.e. when
  $a = bq$ with nothing left over.
</p>

<h2>2. Divisibility</h2>

<p>
  We say $b$ <strong>divides</strong> $a$, written $b \mid a$, if there exists an integer $k$ such
  that $a = bk$. Equivalently, dividing $a$ by $b$ leaves remainder $0$. We also say $b$ is a
  <strong>divisor</strong> or <strong>factor</strong> of $a$, and that $a$ is a <strong>multiple</strong>
  of $b$.
</p>

<p>
  Examples: $3 \mid 12$ (since $12 = 3 \cdot 4$), $7 \mid 0$ (since $0 = 7 \cdot 0$),
  $1 \mid n$ for every integer $n$, and $5 \nmid 17$ (since $17 = 5 \cdot 3 + 2$, remainder $\neq 0$).
</p>

<p>
  Divisibility behaves well under addition and linear combinations:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Proposition (Linearity of divisibility)</div>
  <p>
    If $b \mid a$ and $b \mid c$, then for any integers $m, n$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$b \mid (ma + nc).$$</div>
  <p>
    In particular, $b \mid (a + c)$ and $b \mid (a - c)$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Since $b \mid a$, write $a = bj$ for some integer $j$. Since $b \mid c$, write $c = bk$ for
    some integer $k$. Then
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$ma + nc = m(bj) + n(bk) = b(mj + nk).$$</div>
  <p>
    Since $mj + nk$ is an integer, $b \mid (ma + nc)$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  This "linearity" property is the engine behind almost everything that follows. It says the set
  of multiples of $b$ is closed under integer linear combinations.
</p>

<h2>3. Greatest common divisor</h2>

<p>
  Given two integers $a$ and $b$ (not both zero), their <strong>greatest common divisor</strong>
  $\gcd(a, b)$ is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.
</p>

<p>
  Why does this exist? The set of common divisors of $a$ and $b$ is non-empty ($1$ divides
  everything) and bounded above by $\min(|a|, |b|)$ when both are nonzero. A non-empty bounded
  set of positive integers has a maximum. So $\gcd(a, b)$ is well-defined.
</p>

<p>
  Examples: $\gcd(12, 18) = 6$ (common divisors: $1, 2, 3, 6$), and $\gcd(7, 15) = 1$
  (no common factor besides $1$). When $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we say $a$ and $b$ are <strong>coprime</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Computing the GCD by listing all divisors works for small numbers. For large ones, you need
  something better. Euclid found something much better, over 2300 years ago.
</p>

<h2>4. The Euclidean algorithm</h2>

<p>
  The crucial insight: if $a = bq + r$ (the division algorithm), then $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.
  You can replace the problem with a smaller one, and repeat.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Lemma</div>
  <p>
    If $a = bq + r$, then $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Let $d$ be any common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Then $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$, so by linearity
    of divisibility, $d \mid (a - bq) = r$. So $d$ also divides $r$. Every common divisor of $a$
    and $b$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $r$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, let $d$ be any common divisor of $b$ and $r$. Then $d \mid b$ and $d \mid r$, so
    $d \mid (bq + r) = a$. Every common divisor of $b$ and $r$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two sets of common divisors are identical. Their maxima are therefore equal:
    $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  Now iterate. Apply the division algorithm repeatedly, replacing $a$ with $b$ and $b$ with $r$
  each time, until the remainder is $0$. The last nonzero remainder is the GCD.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Full worked example: $\gcd(252, 105)$.</strong>
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$252 = 105 \cdot 2 + 42$$</div>
<div class="display-math">$$105 = 42 \cdot 2 + 21$$</div>
<div class="display-math">$$42 = 21 \cdot 2 + 0$$</div>

<p>
  The last nonzero remainder is $21$, so $\gcd(252, 105) = 21$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why does it terminate?</strong> The remainders form a strictly decreasing sequence of
  non-negative integers: $42 > 21 > 0$. A strictly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers
  must reach $0$ in finitely many steps (again, the well-ordering principle).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Why does it give the GCD?</strong> By the lemma, each step preserves the GCD:
  $\gcd(252, 105) = \gcd(105, 42) = \gcd(42, 21) = \gcd(21, 0) = 21$. The last equality
  holds because every integer divides $0$, so $\gcd(d, 0) = d$.
</p>

<h2>5. Bezout's identity</h2>

<p>
  Here is the deepest result on this page. The GCD of $a$ and $b$ can always be written as an
  integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. Always.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Bezout's identity)</div>
  <p>
    For any integers $a$ and $b$ (not both zero), there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$ax + by = \gcd(a, b).$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Run the Euclidean algorithm, then substitute backwards. We demonstrate with our example
    $\gcd(252, 105) = 21$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Forward pass</strong> (Euclidean algorithm):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$252 = 105 \cdot 2 + 42 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 42 = 252 - 105 \cdot 2$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$105 = 42 \cdot 2 + 21 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 21 = 105 - 42 \cdot 2$$</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Back-substitution:</strong> Start from the last equation giving the GCD.
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$21 = 105 - 42 \cdot 2$$</div>
  <p>
    Substitute $42 = 252 - 105 \cdot 2$ from the first equation:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$21 = 105 - (252 - 105 \cdot 2) \cdot 2$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$21 = 105 - 252 \cdot 2 + 105 \cdot 4$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$21 = 105 \cdot 5 + 252 \cdot (-2)$$</div>
  <p>
    So $21 = 252 \cdot (-2) + 105 \cdot 5$, giving $x = -2$ and $y = 5$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>General argument.</strong> The back-substitution always works because each remainder
    in the Euclidean algorithm is an integer linear combination of the two remainders from the
    previous step ($r_i = r_{i-2} - r_{i-1} q_i$). Working backwards, each remainder is a linear
    combination of the original $a$ and $b$. The last nonzero remainder is $\gcd(a, b)$, so it
    too is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  Let's verify: $252 \cdot (-2) + 105 \cdot 5 = -504 + 525 = 21$. It works.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Why this matters so much.</em> Bezout's identity says the GCD isn't just a number you can
  compute — it's a number you can <em>build</em> from $a$ and $b$ using only addition, subtraction,
  and multiplication by integers. This constructive property is what makes it so powerful. Nearly
  every result in the rest of this phase (Euclid's lemma, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic,
  Fermat's little theorem, the Chinese remainder theorem) ultimately rests on Bezout.
</p>

<h2>6. Least common multiple</h2>

<p>
  The <strong>least common multiple</strong> of $a$ and $b$, written $\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$,
  is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Proposition</div>
  <p>
    For positive integers $a$ and $b$,
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{ab}{\gcd(a, b)}.$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Let $d = \gcd(a, b)$ and write $a = da'$, $b = db'$ where $\gcd(a', b') = 1$ (dividing
    out the GCD leaves coprime factors). Set $L = ab/d = da'b'$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>$L$ is a common multiple.</strong> $L = da'b' = a \cdot b'$ (a multiple of $a$) and
    $L = da'b' = b \cdot a'$ (a multiple of $b$).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>$L$ is the least such.</strong> Let $m$ be any positive common multiple of $a$ and $b$.
    Write $m = a \cdot k = da'k$ for some positive integer $k$. Since $b \mid m$, we have
    $db' \mid da'k$, so $b' \mid a'k$. But $\gcd(a', b') = 1$, so $b' \mid k$
    (IOU: this uses Euclid's lemma, which we prove on the next page from Bezout's identity).
    Write $k = b'j$, giving $m = da'b'j = Lj$. So $L \mid m$, meaning $L \leq m$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  Example: $\operatorname{lcm}(12, 18) = (12 \cdot 18)/6 = 36$.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    The Euclidean algorithm appears in Book VII of Euclid's <em>Elements</em> (~300 BC), making
    it one of the oldest algorithms in mathematics — older than the word "algorithm" itself, which
    derives from al-Khwarizmi (9th century AD). Euclid stated it for line segments, not numbers:
    repeatedly subtract the shorter from the longer. The numerical version we use is equivalent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bezout's identity is named after Etienne Bezout, who published it in 1770. But the result
    was already implicit in Euclid's work and explicitly stated by Bachet de Meziriac in 1624.
    The back-substitution method is essentially what Euclid was doing, just without algebraic
    notation.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the division algorithm?</strong> You can't define divisibility rigorously.
    The uniqueness of quotient and remainder is what makes "$b$ divides $a$" an unambiguous
    statement. Without it, the Euclidean algorithm doesn't even make sense — you need the remainder
    to be well-defined at each step.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without Bezout's identity?</strong> Many critical results collapse. Here is the most
    important: the characterisation of coprimality. $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ if and only if there exist
    integers $x, y$ with $ax + by = 1$. The "only if" direction is Bezout. Without it, you cannot
    prove Euclid's lemma (if $p \mid ab$ and $p$ is prime, then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$). Without
    Euclid's lemma, you cannot prove unique prime factorisation. Without unique factorisation, vast
    areas of number theory and algebra are unmoored. Bezout is the load-bearing wall.
