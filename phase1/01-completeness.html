<h1>Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Filling the Holes — Phase 1, Page 1</p>

<!-- --- 1. THE PROBLEM ---------------------------------- -->

<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    In Phase 0 we proved that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational — a length you can draw with a
    straightedge but a number that has no home in $\mathbb{Q}$. That was bad enough. But
    the situation is worse than one missing number.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the sequence of rational approximations to $\sqrt{2}$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$1, \quad 1.4, \quad 1.41, \quad 1.414, \quad 1.4142, \quad 1.41421, \quad \ldots$$</div>
  <p>
    Every single term is rational. And the terms are getting closer and closer to each other —
    the gap between consecutive terms shrinks: $0.4$, then $0.01$, then $0.004$, then $0.0002$,
    and so on. After enough terms, any two terms in the tail of the sequence are as close as you like.
    This sequence <em>should</em> converge. It is begging to converge.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the number it's approaching — $\sqrt{2}$ — isn't in $\mathbb{Q}$.
    The limit <strong>does not exist</strong> in the rational numbers.
    The sequence converges to nothing. It reaches for a point on the number line that,
    from $\mathbb{Q}$'s perspective, simply isn't there.
  </p>
  <p>
    And $\sqrt{2}$ isn't special. The same happens with $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, $\pi$, $e$,
    $\ln 2$ — the rationals are riddled with holes. You can't do analysis (limits, derivatives,
    integrals) in a number system where limits might not exist.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- --- 2. WHAT WE NEED --------------------------------- -->

<h2>What we need</h2>

<p>
  We need a number system with <strong>no holes</strong>. A system where every sequence that
  "should" converge — every sequence whose terms are getting arbitrarily close to each other —
  actually does converge to something <em>inside</em> the system. No escaping to some larger
  number system to find your limit; the limit is already here.
</p>

<p>
  The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are exactly this system. They are $\mathbb{Q}$ with the holes
  filled in. But we need to say precisely what "no holes" means. That's the completeness axiom,
  and it's phrased not in terms of sequences (that comes later) but in terms of <em>bounds</em>.
</p>

<!-- --- 3. KEY DEFINITIONS ------------------------------ -->

<h2>Building the language</h2>

<p>
  Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{Q}$ — these definitions work in both).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Upper bound.</strong> A number $M$ is an <em>upper bound</em> for $S$ if every element of
  $S$ is $\leq M$. Nothing in $S$ exceeds $M$.
</p>

<p>
  Example: take $S = \{1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \ldots\}$, our sequence of rational approximations to
  $\sqrt{2}$. Then $2$ is an upper bound. So is $1.5$. So is $1.41422$. There are infinitely many
  upper bounds.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Bounded above.</strong> A set is <em>bounded above</em> if it has at least one upper bound.
  The set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ is <em>not</em> bounded above — no finite number sits above every
  natural number.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Least upper bound (supremum).</strong> The <em>least upper bound</em> of $S$, written
  $\sup(S)$, is the <strong>smallest</strong> upper bound. It's the tightest ceiling you can put on $S$:
  an upper bound such that no smaller number is also an upper bound.
</p>

<p>
  This is where things get interesting. Consider the set
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}$$</div>
<p>
  All rationals whose square is less than 2. This set is non-empty ($1 \in S$) and bounded above
  ($2$ is an upper bound). What's its least upper bound?
</p>

<p>
  In $\mathbb{R}$, the answer is $\sqrt{2}$. It's an upper bound (if $x^2 < 2$ and $x \geq 0$,
  then $x < \sqrt{2}$), and no smaller number works (for any $M < \sqrt{2}$, there's a rational
  $x$ with $M < x$ and $x^2 < 2$).
</p>

<p>
  But in $\mathbb{Q}$? There is no least upper bound. $\sqrt{2}$ itself is irrational — it's not
  available. And there's no smallest rational number whose square exceeds 2. You can always find a
  rational closer to $\sqrt{2}$ from above: $1.42$, $1.415$, $1.4143$, ... squeezing down but never
  reaching a smallest upper bound. The supremum simply does not exist in $\mathbb{Q}$.
</p>

<p>
  This is the hole. This is what "incomplete" means.
</p>

<!-- --- 4. THE AXIOM ------------------------------------ -->

<h2>The axiom</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Completeness Axiom (Least Upper Bound Property)</div>
  <p>
    Every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound
    (supremum) in $\mathbb{R}$.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- --- 5. UNPACKING ------------------------------------ -->

<h2>Unpacking every word</h2>

<p>
  Every condition in the axiom is load-bearing. Remove any one and the statement becomes false
  or meaningless.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>"Non-empty."</strong> The empty set $\varnothing$ is bounded above by every real number
  (vacuously — there's nothing in $\varnothing$ to violate the bound). But it has no
  <em>least</em> upper bound, because every real number is an upper bound and there is no smallest
  real number. The condition excludes this pathology.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>"Bounded above."</strong> The set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\} = \mathbb{N}$ is non-empty but
  not bounded above. It has no upper bound at all, let alone a least one. The axiom doesn't
  claim every set has a supremum — only those with at least one upper bound.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>"In $\mathbb{R}$."</strong> This is the crucial phrase. The exact same statement with
  $\mathbb{Q}$ replacing $\mathbb{R}$ is <strong>false</strong>. The set
  $\{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}$ is non-empty, bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$, but has no
  supremum in $\mathbb{Q}$. Completeness is the property that separates $\mathbb{R}$ from
  $\mathbb{Q}$.
</p>

<!-- --- 6. WHY AN AXIOM --------------------------------- -->

<h2>Why is this an axiom, not a theorem?</h2>

<p>
  You can't <em>prove</em> completeness. It's not a consequence of the arithmetic axioms
  (addition, multiplication, ordering) — those axioms are satisfied by $\mathbb{Q}$ as well,
  and $\mathbb{Q}$ is not complete.
</p>

<p>
  Completeness is <strong>built into the definition</strong> of $\mathbb{R}$. When mathematicians
  say "the real numbers", they mean: the unique ordered field that satisfies the completeness
  axiom. There are two classical ways to construct such a system starting from $\mathbb{Q}$:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dedekind cuts</strong> — partition $\mathbb{Q}$ into two halves $(L, R)$ where every
    element of $L$ is less than every element of $R$. The "cut" itself defines a real number.
    The cut at $\sqrt{2}$ is: $L = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x < 0 \text{ or } x^2 < 2\}$,
    $R = \mathbb{Q} \setminus L$. The cut exists even though $\sqrt{2}$ doesn't live in
    $\mathbb{Q}$ — the cut <em>is</em> the real number $\sqrt{2}$.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cauchy sequences</strong> — take all sequences of rationals whose terms get arbitrarily
    close to each other (we'll make this precise later in Phase 1). Two such sequences are "the same
    real number" if their difference converges to zero. Each equivalence class is a real number.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both constructions produce the same $\mathbb{R}$, and both are designed specifically so that the
  completeness axiom holds. $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$ with the holes filled in.
  Completeness is the formal definition of "filled in".
</p>

<!-- --- 7. HISTORY -------------------------------------- -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Richard Dedekind (1858, published 1872) was teaching calculus at the Zurich Polytechnic and
    realised he couldn't rigorously prove the intermediate value theorem. The problem wasn't the
    theorem itself — it was that nobody had a precise definition of the real numbers. Dedekind's
    "cuts" gave the first rigorous construction of $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Georg Cantor (independently, also 1872) approached the same problem through sequences. His
    construction used equivalence classes of what we now call Cauchy sequences. Different roads,
    same destination: a complete ordered field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both were motivated by the same crisis. Calculus had been used successfully for two centuries
    (Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Fourier) without anyone pinning down what "real number" actually meant.
    Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor finally demanded precision — and completeness was the answer.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- --- 8. INFIMUM -------------------------------------- -->

<h2>The infimum</h2>

<p>
  Everything has a mirror image. A <strong>lower bound</strong> for $S$ is a number $m$ with
  $m \leq x$ for every $x \in S$. The <strong>greatest lower bound</strong> (or <em>infimum</em>,
  written $\inf(S)$) is the largest such $m$.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Corollary</div>
  <p>
    Every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound
    (infimum) in $\mathbb{R}$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  This follows directly from the completeness axiom. If $S$ is bounded below, consider the set
  $-S = \{-x : x \in S\}$. Then $-S$ is bounded above, so it has a supremum $M = \sup(-S)$ in
  $\mathbb{R}$. Then $\inf(S) = -M$. The axiom gives us both directions for free.
</p>

<!-- --- 9. WHY THIS MATTERS ----------------------------- -->

<h2>Why this matters for everything that follows</h2>

<p>
  Every convergence theorem you'll meet in Phase 1 ultimately depends on completeness:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The squeeze theorem</strong> (next page) — a squeezed sequence converges because
    its limit exists in $\mathbb{R}$.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monotone convergence theorem</strong> — a bounded increasing sequence converges.
    The limit is the supremum of its range, which exists by completeness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bolzano-Weierstrass</strong> — every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
    Relies on nested intervals, which rely on completeness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cauchy criterion</strong> — a sequence converges if and only if its terms get
    arbitrarily close to each other. The "only if" direction is trivial; the "if" direction
    requires completeness.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Without completeness, limits might not exist, and analysis collapses. This single axiom is
  the foundation that separates $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ and makes calculus rigorous.
  Every time a theorem says "the limit exists" or "the supremum exists", it's invoking
  completeness — often silently.
</p>

<!-- --- 10. WHAT BREAKS --------------------------------- -->

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    In $\mathbb{Q}$, completeness fails. The sequence $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \ldots$ has no
    limit in $\mathbb{Q}$. The monotone convergence theorem fails: the sequence is increasing,
    bounded above by $2$, but doesn't converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The intermediate value theorem fails: the function $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ satisfies $f(1) = -1 < 0$
    and $f(2) = 2 > 0$, so it "should" cross zero somewhere between 1 and 2. But $x^2 - 2 = 0$
    has no solution in $\mathbb{Q}$ — the function jumps from negative to positive without ever
    passing through zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    No supremum. No limits. No intermediate value theorem. No mean value theorem. No integration
    theory. Everything breaks.
  </p>
