<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Consider the sequence $a_n = \sin(n)$. Compute a few terms: $\sin(1) \approx 0.841$,
    $\sin(2) \approx 0.909$, $\sin(3) \approx 0.141$, $\sin(4) \approx -0.757$,
    $\sin(5) \approx -0.959$, $\sin(6) \approx -0.279$, $\sin(7) \approx 0.657\ldots$
    The sequence bounces around inside $[-1, 1]$ without ever settling down. It doesn't converge.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it's <strong>bounded</strong>. Every term lives in $[-1, 1]$. And there are infinitely
    many terms crammed into this finite interval. Surely <em>some</em> of those terms must
    cluster near a particular value?
  </p>
  <p>
    The question: even though the whole sequence refuses to converge, can we
    <strong>cherry-pick</strong> terms from it &mdash; keeping their original order &mdash;
    to form a new sequence that <em>does</em> converge?
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. SUBSEQUENCES ────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Subsequences</h2>

<p>
  Before stating the theorem, we need a precise definition. A <strong>subsequence</strong>
  of $(a_n)$ is formed by choosing an infinite collection of indices
  $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$ and taking the terms $a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, a_{n_3}, \ldots$
  You keep the original order. You skip terms. But you never go backwards, and you never stop
  &mdash; a subsequence must be infinite.
</p>

<p>
  We write this subsequence as $(a_{n_k})_{k \geq 1}$, where the map $k \mapsto n_k$ is
  strictly increasing.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example.</strong> From $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots$ take only the even-indexed terms:
  $a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots$ Here $n_k = 2k$. Or take every tenth term: $n_k = 10k$.
  Or take primes: $n_1 = 2, n_2 = 3, n_3 = 5, n_4 = 7, \ldots$ All valid subsequences.
</p>

<p>
  What is <em>not</em> a subsequence: picking $a_5, a_3, a_7$ (indices aren't increasing),
  or picking finitely many terms (a subsequence must be infinite).
</p>

<p>
  Back to $\sin(n)$: we want to find indices $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$ such that
  $\sin(n_k)$ converges to some limit $L$ as $k \to \infty$. Can we always do this
  for any bounded sequence?
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Bolzano proved this in 1817, but not because he cared about subsequences. He was trying
    to give the first rigorous proof of the <strong>Intermediate Value Theorem</strong>
    (if a continuous function goes from negative to positive, it must cross zero). His proof
    required a lemma: if infinitely many points are packed into a bounded interval, at least
    some must cluster together. He proved the lemma &mdash; and it turned out to be far more
    important than the IVT itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weierstrass, decades later, generalised it, taught it in his Berlin lectures, and gave it
    the central place it holds today. The theorem they were after (IVT) became a corollary.
    The tool (Bolzano-Weierstrass) became a pillar of analysis.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 5. THE PROOF ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The proof: bisection</h2>

<p>
  This is one of the most elegant constructions in analysis. It's also fully <em>constructive</em>
  &mdash; it tells you exactly how to build the convergent subsequence, step by step.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    Let $(a_n)$ be a bounded sequence. Since it's bounded, all terms sit inside some
    interval $[a, b]$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. First bisection.</strong>
    Cut $[a, b]$ into two halves: $\bigl[a, \frac{a+b}{2}\bigr]$ and
    $\bigl[\frac{a+b}{2}, b\bigr]$. The sequence has infinitely many terms in $[a, b]$.
    At least one of the two halves must contain <strong>infinitely many terms</strong>.
    (If both halves had only finitely many, the total would be finite &mdash; contradiction.)
    Pick a half that contains infinitely many terms. Call it $[a_1, b_1]$.
    Choose any term of the sequence that lies in $[a_1, b_1]$; call it $a_{n_1}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Second bisection.</strong>
    Cut $[a_1, b_1]$ in half. Again, at least one half contains infinitely many terms of the
    sequence. Pick that half; call it $[a_2, b_2]$. Now choose a term $a_{n_2}$ that lies
    in $[a_2, b_2]$ with $n_2 > n_1$. We can always find such a term because $[a_2, b_2]$
    contains infinitely many terms &mdash; so in particular, it contains terms with
    arbitrarily large indices.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step $k$. Repeat.</strong>
    At stage $k$, we have a nested interval $[a_k, b_k]$ of length
    $\frac{b - a}{2^k}$, and we've selected a term $a_{n_k}$ inside it with
    $n_k > n_{k-1}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>What have we built?</strong> Two things:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      A sequence of <strong>nested intervals</strong> $[a_1, b_1] \supset [a_2, b_2]
      \supset [a_3, b_3] \supset \cdots$ with lengths
      $b_k - a_k = \frac{b-a}{2^k} \to 0$.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>subsequence</strong> $(a_{n_k})$ with $a_{n_k} \in [a_k, b_k]$ for
      every $k$, and $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong>Convergence.</strong>
    The left endpoints $a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \cdots$ form an <strong>increasing</strong>
    sequence (each bisection can only move the left endpoint rightward or keep it).
    They're bounded above by $b$. So by the
    <strong>Monotone Convergence Theorem</strong> (page 03), the sequence $(a_k)$ converges
    to some limit $L$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, $b_k = a_k + \frac{b-a}{2^k}$, so $b_k \to L + 0 = L$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now: for every $k$, the subsequence term $a_{n_k}$ satisfies
    $a_k \leq a_{n_k} \leq b_k$. Both $a_k \to L$ and $b_k \to L$. By the
    <strong>Squeeze Theorem</strong> (page 02):
  </p>

  <div class="display-math">$$a_{n_k} \to L$$</div>

  <p>
    The subsequence converges.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<!-- ─── 6. UNPACKING ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Unpacking the proof</h2>

<p>
  Notice what happened. The proof used <strong>two results from previous pages</strong>:
  the Monotone Convergence Theorem (to show the left endpoints converge) and the Squeeze
  Theorem (to trap the subsequence between converging bounds). Bolzano-Weierstrass isn't
  conjured from nothing &mdash; it's built on the machinery we've already established.
</p>

<p>
  The engine of the proof is the <strong>pigeonhole step</strong>: when you cut an interval
  containing infinitely many terms into two halves, at least one half must still contain
  infinitely many terms. You can't split infinity into two finite pieces. This simple
  observation is what lets the construction continue forever &mdash; at every stage, there
  are enough terms left to pick from.
</p>

<p>
  The bisection halves the interval each time. After $k$ steps, the interval has length
  $(b-a)/2^k$, which marches toward zero. The subsequence terms are trapped in
  ever-shrinking intervals, forced to converge whether they like it or not.
</p>

<!-- ─── 7. RETURN TO sin(n) ────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Back to $\sin(n)$</h2>

<p>
  The theorem guarantees that $(\sin(n))$ has a convergent subsequence. It doesn't tell us
  <em>which</em> indices to pick &mdash; finding them explicitly is surprisingly hard. It
  involves the distribution of integers modulo $2\pi$, which is governed by the irrationality
  of $\pi$ and Weyl's equidistribution theorem. The terms $\sin(n)$ are in fact
  <em>dense</em> in $[-1, 1]$: for any target value $L \in [-1, 1]$, you can find a
  subsequence converging to it. Bolzano-Weierstrass says at least one such subsequence
  exists; the equidistribution theory says every $L \in [-1, 1]$ works.
</p>

<p>
  But we didn't need any of that machinery. The proof only needed boundedness.
</p>

<!-- ─── 8. SIMPLER EXAMPLE ─────────────────────────── -->

<h2>A simpler example</h2>

<p>
  Take $a_n = (-1)^n$, i.e. $-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, \ldots$ This is bounded (by $[-1, 1]$)
  and doesn't converge (it oscillates forever).
</p>

<p>
  Subsequences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Odd terms: $a_1, a_3, a_5, \ldots = -1, -1, -1, \ldots \to -1$</li>
  <li>Even terms: $a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots = 1, 1, 1, \ldots \to 1$</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Two different convergent subsequences with two different limits. Bolzano-Weierstrass
  guarantees <em>at least one</em>; there could be many. In fact, the set of all subsequential
  limits of a bounded sequence is always closed and non-empty &mdash; a deeper result
  you'll meet later.
</p>

<!-- ─── 9. WHAT BREAKS ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What breaks</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">Remove "bounded"</div>
  <p>
    Take $a_n = n$: $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ Every subsequence still diverges to $+\infty$.
    More precisely, if $n_{k+1} > n_k$ then $a_{n_k} = n_k \geq k$, so $a_{n_k} \to \infty$.
    No convergent subsequence exists. Boundedness is essential.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">Work in $\mathbb{Q}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$</div>
  <p>
    Consider the decimal approximations of $\sqrt{2}$: $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, \ldots$
    Every term is rational. The sequence is bounded (all terms in $[1, 2]$). It converges
    &mdash; but its limit is $\sqrt{2}$, which is <strong>not in $\mathbb{Q}$</strong>.
    If we demand the subsequence converge to a <em>rational</em> limit, the theorem fails.
    A bounded sequence of rationals can have only irrational cluster points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bolzano-Weierstrass relies on the <strong>completeness of $\mathbb{R}$</strong>
    (page 01). The bisection proof invokes the Monotone Convergence Theorem, which itself
    depends on completeness. Pull out completeness, and the whole construction collapses.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 10. WHY THIS MATTERS ───────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>
  Bolzano-Weierstrass is the concrete version of <strong>compactness</strong>. In $\mathbb{R}$,
  it says: bounded closed sets have the "clustering property" &mdash; any sequence inside them
  has a convergent subsequence whose limit is also in the set. In Phase 8 (topology), this
  becomes the abstract definition of sequential compactness. But the idea is born right here,
  in this bisection argument.
</p>

<p>
  Practically, BW is the workhorse behind dozens of existence theorems. The Extreme Value
  Theorem (a continuous function on $[a, b]$ attains its maximum) uses it. The
  Arzel&agrave;-Ascoli theorem (compactness in function spaces) generalises it.
  Every time you need to show that <em>some</em> convergent subsequence exists &mdash;
  without exhibiting it explicitly &mdash; Bolzano-Weierstrass is the tool.
