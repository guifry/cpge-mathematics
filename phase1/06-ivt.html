<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    You're driving from London (sea level) to the summit of Ben Nevis (1,345m).
    Your altitude is a continuous function of time — you don't teleport, you drive smoothly
    up roads and hills. At some point during the journey, you must have been at exactly 500m.
    And exactly 1000m. And every height in between.
  </p>
  <p>
    This feels obvious. A curve that starts at 0 and ends at 1,345 can't skip over 500 without
    a break. But <strong>can you prove it?</strong> And what property of $\mathbb{R}$ makes it true?
    Because here's the thing — the same argument fails in $\mathbb{Q}$. If your number line
    had holes in it, a continuous function <em>could</em> skip over values. The real line's lack
    of holes is doing all the work. Let's make that precise.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. CONTINUITY ──────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>First: what is continuity?</h2>

<p>
  We keep saying "continuous" — the curve has no jumps, no teleportation. But mathematics doesn't
  run on vibes. We need a definition sharp enough to prove things with.
</p>

<p>
  A function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is <strong>continuous at a point $c$</strong> if
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$$</div>
<p>
  Unpack this in $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ language: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists
  $\delta > 0$ such that
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$|x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$$</div>
<p>
  In words: <em>small changes in input produce small changes in output</em>. You nudge $x$
  a little and $f(x)$ only nudges a little. No jumps, no sudden leaps. The output tracks
  the input smoothly.
</p>

<p>
  We say $f$ is <strong>continuous on $[a, b]$</strong> if it's continuous at every point in $[a, b]$.
  (At the endpoints $a$ and $b$, we use the appropriate one-sided limits.)
</p>

<p>
  That's all continuity is. It doesn't mean "smooth" (derivatives exist) or "nice-looking."
  It just means: no teleportation.
</p>

<!-- ─── 3. THEOREM ─────────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The theorem</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</div>
  <p>
    If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$ (or $f(a) > 0 > f(b)$), then
    there exists $c \in (a, b)$ with $f(c) = 0$.
  </p>
  <p>
    More generally: if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $v$ is any value between $f(a)$ and
    $f(b)$, then there exists $c \in [a, b]$ with $f(c) = v$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The general version follows from the zero-crossing version by applying it to $g(x) = f(x) - v$.
  So the heart of the IVT is the zero-crossing case: negative on one side, positive on the other,
  continuous in between — there must be a zero somewhere.
</p>

<!-- ─── 4. HISTORY ─────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Bolzano gave the first rigorous proof in 1817. This is the same Bolzano from the
    Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (page 04) — and the connection is not a coincidence. Bolzano
    discovered what we now call BW <em>as a lemma for proving the IVT</em>. He needed bounded
    sequences to converge, so he proved they do, then used that to prove the IVT.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IVT seems geometrically obvious: a continuous curve that starts below zero and ends
    above zero must cross the axis. Every student draws the picture and says "of course."
    But Bolzano understood what most mathematicians of his era did not — that "obvious" geometric
    intuitions about continuous curves need rigorous foundations. The proof requires
    <strong>completeness of $\mathbb{R}$</strong>. Without it, the theorem is actually false.
    Bolzano was one of the first to see this clearly.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 5. THE PROOF ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The proof — bisection</h2>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    Assume $f(a) < 0$ and $f(b) > 0$. We'll hunt for the zero using interval halving — the
    same bisection idea we saw in the BW proof (page 04).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Set up.</strong>
    Let $[a_0, b_0] = [a, b]$. We have $f(a_0) < 0$ and $f(b_0) > 0$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Bisect.</strong>
    Compute the midpoint $m = (a_0 + b_0) / 2$. Three cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If $f(m) = 0$, we're done — $c = m$.</li>
    <li>If $f(m) < 0$, set $[a_1, b_1] = [m, b_0]$. The zero is in the right half.</li>
    <li>If $f(m) > 0$, set $[a_1, b_1] = [a_0, m]$. The zero is in the left half.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Either way: $f(a_1) \leq 0$ and $f(b_1) \geq 0$, and the interval is half as long.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3. Iterate.</strong>
    Repeat: at stage $n$, we have a closed interval $[a_n, b_n]$ with $f(a_n) \leq 0$,
    $f(b_n) \geq 0$, and length
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$b_n - a_n = \frac{b - a}{2^n}$$</div>
  <p>
    The intervals are nested: $[a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}] \subseteq [a_n, b_n]$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4. Convergence.</strong>
    The sequence $(a_n)$ is increasing (each left endpoint moves right or stays) and
    bounded above by $b$. By the <strong>Monotone Convergence Theorem</strong> (page 03),
    it converges to some limit $c$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sequence $(b_n)$ is decreasing and bounded below by $a$, so it also converges.
    Since $b_n - a_n = (b - a) / 2^n \to 0$, both sequences converge to the
    <strong>same limit $c$</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5. The limit is a zero.</strong>
    Since $f$ is continuous and $a_n \to c$, we have $f(a_n) \to f(c)$. (This is what
    continuity means: limits commute with continuous functions.) But $f(a_n) \leq 0$ for all $n$,
    so $f(c) \leq 0$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, $b_n \to c$ and $f(b_n) \geq 0$ for all $n$, so $f(c) \geq 0$.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have $f(c) \leq 0$ and $f(c) \geq 0$. Therefore $f(c) = 0$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<!-- ─── 6. UNPACK ──────────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Unpacking the proof</h2>

<p>
  Let's be explicit about what's doing what.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>bisection</strong> is a search algorithm. At each step, we know the zero is
  trapped in our interval (because $f$ is negative on the left, positive on the right).
  Halving narrows the trap. But an algorithm that produces better and better approximations
  is useless unless we can guarantee those approximations converge to something.
</p>

<p>
  That's where <strong>completeness</strong> enters. The Monotone Convergence Theorem — which
  itself is equivalent to the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ (page 03) — guarantees the nested,
  shrinking intervals close in on a point $c$. In $\mathbb{Q}$, this step would fail. The
  intervals might shrink around a hole.
</p>

<p>
  And <strong>continuity</strong> is what transfers the sign condition from the endpoints to the
  limit. We know $f(a_n) \leq 0$ for every $n$. Continuity turns this into $f(c) \leq 0$.
  Without continuity, $f$ could jump at $c$ and dodge zero entirely.
</p>

<p>
  So the proof is a three-part machine: <em>bisection</em> (search), <em>completeness</em>
  (the search converges), <em>continuity</em> (the limit is actually a zero). Remove any one and it breaks.
</p>

<!-- ─── 7. CONNECTED SETS ──────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Connected sets — the deeper idea</h2>

<p>
  Why does the IVT work on $[a, b]$ but fail on, say, $[0, 1] \cup [2, 3]$ (two disjoint intervals)?
  Because $[a, b]$ is <strong>connected</strong> — you can't split it into two separated pieces — and
  the union of two disjoint intervals is not.
</p>

<p>
  The IVT is really a theorem about connected sets. What it's saying, in topological language, is:
  <strong>the continuous image of a connected set is connected</strong>. If $f$ maps $[a, b]$
  continuously, the image $f([a, b])$ must also be connected — which, for subsets of $\mathbb{R}$,
  means it's an interval. It contains every value between its minimum and maximum.
</p>

<p>
  This topological perspective generalises far beyond $\mathbb{R}$. In any topological space,
  continuous functions preserve connectedness. The IVT on the real line is a special case of this
  universal principle. We'll return to this in Phase 8 when we study topological spaces properly.
</p>

<p>
  For now, the takeaway: intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ are connected because $\mathbb{R}$ is complete.
  Completeness gives connectedness. Connectedness gives the IVT. The chain of dependencies runs all
  the way back to the axioms.
</p>

<!-- ─── 8. APPLICATION ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Application: existence of roots</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">Problem</div>
  <p>
    Prove that the equation $x^5 + x - 1 = 0$ has a solution.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Let $f(x) = x^5 + x - 1$. Check the endpoints:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$f(0) = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1 < 0$$</div>
<div class="display-math">$$f(1) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 > 0$$</div>
<p>
  $f$ is a polynomial, hence continuous everywhere — certainly on $[0, 1]$. By the IVT, there
  exists $c \in (0, 1)$ with $f(c) = 0$.
</p>

<p>
  We can't write down $c$ exactly. There's no radical formula for degree 5 polynomials — that's
  the Abel-Ruffini theorem (Phase 9). But we know $c$ <em>exists</em>, and we could approximate it
  to any desired precision by continuing the bisection ($f(0.5) < 0$, so $c \in (0.5, 1)$;
  $f(0.75) > 0$, so $c \in (0.5, 0.75)$; and so on, forever).
</p>

<p>
  This is the power of the IVT: <strong>existence without a formula</strong>. You can prove a root
  exists without ever finding it explicitly. And the bisection proof is constructive — it gives you
  an algorithm to approximate the root to arbitrary accuracy.
</p>

<!-- ─── 9. WHAT BREAKS ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What breaks</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">Without continuity</div>
  <p>
    Let $f(x) = -1$ for $x < 0$ and $f(x) = 1$ for $x \geq 0$. Then $f(-1) = -1 < 0$ and
    $f(1) = 1 > 0$, but $f$ is never zero. The function jumps from $-1$ to $1$ at the
    origin — it <em>skips over</em> zero. The jump breaks continuity, and without continuity
    the sign condition at the endpoints tells you nothing about what happens in between.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">In $\mathbb{Q}$ — the holes matter</div>
  <p>
    Let $f(x) = x^2 - 2$, defined for rational $x$ only. Then $f(1) = -1 < 0$ and
    $f(2) = 2 > 0$. $f$ is continuous (as a function on $\mathbb{Q}$). But $f(c) = 0$
    requires $c = \sqrt{2}$, and $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$ (Phase 0, page 3). The bisection
    intervals shrink around $\sqrt{2}$, but that point doesn't exist in $\mathbb{Q}$.
    The function crosses from negative to positive, but there's no rational point where it
    actually equals zero — it steps across a hole.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the IVT failing because $\mathbb{Q}$ is not connected. The rationals are riddled
    with gaps, and continuous functions can slip through them. Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is
    not a technicality — it's the entire reason the IVT is true.
  </p>
