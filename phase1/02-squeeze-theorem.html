<h1>The Squeeze Theorem</h1>

<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Compute the following limit:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sin(n)}{n}$$</div>
  <p>
    We know exactly what $\sin(n)$ is. Back in Phase 0, we defined sine via the unit circle:
    $\sin(\theta)$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point at angle $\theta$ on the unit circle.
    We proved that $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$, which immediately gives $|\sin(\theta)| \leq 1$.
    None of that is assumed here — it's established.
  </p>
  <p>
    But $\sin(n)$, where $n$ runs through the integers $1, 2, 3, \ldots$, bounces erratically.
    It's not periodic over the integers (because $\pi$ is irrational, so $n$ never lands on a
    clean multiple of $\pi$). The values jump around between $-1$ and $1$ with no discernible pattern.
    We cannot compute $\sin(1) + \sin(2) + \sin(3) + \cdots$ or track where $\sin(n)$ goes.
    So how could we possibly determine what $\frac{\sin(n)}{n}$ approaches?
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. WHAT IS A SEQUENCE? ─────────────────────── -->

<h2>First, what IS a sequence?</h2>

<p>
  Before we can talk about limits, we need to say precisely what we're taking the limit <em>of</em>.
</p>

<p>
  A <strong>sequence</strong> is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. That's it. You feed it
  a positive integer, it gives you back a real number. We write it $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$, or just $(a_n)$,
  or $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ The subscript $n$ is the <strong>index</strong> — the position in the list.
  The value $a_n$ is the <strong>$n$-th term</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Examples: $a_n = 1/n$ gives the sequence $1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots$
  The sequence $b_n = (-1)^n$ gives $-1, 1, -1, 1, \ldots$
  Our problem sequence is $c_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}$.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence is <em>not</em> a set. The sequence $1, 1, 1, \ldots$ has infinitely many terms but only
  one distinct value. Order and repetition matter.
</p>

<!-- ─── 3. WHAT IS A LIMIT? ────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What does "limit" mean, precisely?</h2>

<p>
  Informally: $a_n$ approaches $L$ as $n$ grows. The terms get closer and closer to $L$ and
  eventually stay as close as you want. But "closer and closer" is vague. Mathematics demands precision.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition — limit of a sequence</div>
  <p>
    We say $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L$ if: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists
    $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$,
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  Unpack this piece by piece.
</p>

<p>
  $\varepsilon$ (epsilon) is any positive real number — any tolerance you choose, however small.
  You pick $\varepsilon = 0.1$? Fine. You pick $\varepsilon = 0.0001$? Also fine. You pick
  $\varepsilon = 10^{-100}$? Still fine. The definition must work for <em>every</em> such choice.
</p>

<p>
  $N$ is a position in the sequence — a threshold index. The claim is: beyond this position,
  <em>every single term</em> lies within distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$. Not "most terms". Not
  "infinitely many terms". <strong>All terms from position $N$ onwards.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  $|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$ means $a_n$ sits in the open interval $(L - \varepsilon, L + \varepsilon)$.
  Every term past $N$ is trapped in that interval.
</p>

<p>
  The key trade-off: the smaller you make $\varepsilon$, the larger $N$ might need to be. If you
  demand the terms stay within $0.01$ of $L$, you might need to go past position $100$. If you demand
  $0.0001$, maybe past position $10{,}000$. But the definition says $N$ <strong>always exists</strong>,
  no matter how small $\varepsilon$ is. That's what convergence means.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence that has a limit is called <strong>convergent</strong>. One that doesn't is <strong>divergent</strong>.
</p>

<!-- ─── 4. BACK TO THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────── -->

<h2>Back to the problem</h2>

<p>
  Our sequence is $c_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}$. We suspect it converges to $0$, but $\sin(n)$ is wild
  and we can't control it directly.
</p>

<p>
  Here's the key observation. We proved (Phase 0, page 5) that $-1 \leq \sin(\theta) \leq 1$ for
  all $\theta$. So in particular, $-1 \leq \sin(n) \leq 1$ for every positive integer $n$.
  Now divide through by $n$ (which is positive, so the inequalities don't flip):
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\frac{-1}{n} \leq \frac{\sin(n)}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n}$$</div>

<p>
  Look at what we've done. We've trapped $\frac{\sin(n)}{n}$ between two sequences:
  $a_n = -\frac{1}{n}$ below and $c_n = \frac{1}{n}$ above. Both of these converge to $0$ as
  $n \to \infty$ (we can verify this directly from the $\varepsilon$-$N$ definition: given $\varepsilon > 0$,
  pick $N > 1/\varepsilon$, then for $n \geq N$, $|1/n - 0| = 1/n \leq 1/N < \varepsilon$).
</p>

<p>
  So $\frac{\sin(n)}{n}$ is squeezed between two sequences that both converge to $0$. It has
  nowhere to go. No matter how $\sin(n)$ bounces around, dividing by $n$ crushes the oscillation,
  and the bounds force the result to $0$.
</p>

<p>
  This is the squeeze theorem in action. But we haven't proved it yet — we've only seen why it should
  be true. Let's formalise.
</p>

<!-- ─── 5. HISTORY ─────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Archimedes (~250 BC) used exactly this idea to compute the area of a circle. He couldn't
    compute the area directly — a circle has a curved boundary, and Greek mathematics had no
    tools for curves. So he <em>trapped</em> the circle between two shapes he could measure:
    a regular polygon inscribed inside the circle (area too small) and a regular polygon
    circumscribed outside it (area too large).
  </p>
  <p>
    As the number of sides grows, the inner polygon expands toward the circle and the outer polygon
    contracts toward it. Both sequences of polygon areas approach the circle's area from opposite sides.
    Archimedes proved that the gap between them can be made arbitrarily small — which pins down the
    circle's area exactly. He used this to prove that $A = \pi r^2$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Greeks called this the <strong>method of exhaustion</strong>. The squeeze theorem is Archimedes'
    method of exhaustion, translated into the language of sequences and limits — formalised two thousand
    years later by Cauchy and Weierstrass.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 6. THE THEOREM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The theorem</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem — Squeeze Theorem</div>
  <p>
    Let $(a_n)$, $(b_n)$, $(c_n)$ be sequences of real numbers. Suppose that:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>$a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$ for all $n$ (or at least for all $n$ beyond some threshold), and</li>
    <li>$\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} c_n = L$ (same limit).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Then $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = L$.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 7. UNPACKING ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Unpacking every piece</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Three sequences, not two.</strong> The middle sequence $b_n$ is the one we can't control.
  The outer two, $a_n$ and $c_n$, are the trap. We need both sides — one bound alone isn't enough
  (more on this in the "what breaks" section below).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>"For all $n$" can be relaxed.</strong> The inequality $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$ only needs
  to hold eventually — say, for all $n \geq M$ for some fixed $M$. What happens at finitely many
  early terms is irrelevant to the limit, which only cares about the tail of the sequence.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Same limit $L$ is essential.</strong> If $a_n \to 2$ and $c_n \to 5$, then $b_n$ is
  trapped between $2$ and $5$ eventually, but that doesn't pin it to a single value.
  It could converge to $3$, or to $4.7$, or oscillate without converging at all. The squeeze
  only works when both jaws close to the <em>same</em> point.
</p>

<!-- ─── 8. THE PROOF ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The proof</h2>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    We must show: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$,
    $|b_n - L| < \varepsilon$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Fix an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Since $\lim a_n = L$, the definition of limit gives us an $N_1$
    such that for all $n \geq N_1$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$$</div>
  <p>
    This means $L - \varepsilon < a_n < L + \varepsilon$. We only need the left half:
    $a_n > L - \varepsilon$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> Since $\lim c_n = L$, the definition gives us an $N_2$
    such that for all $n \geq N_2$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$|c_n - L| < \varepsilon$$</div>
  <p>
    This means $L - \varepsilon < c_n < L + \varepsilon$. We only need the right half:
    $c_n < L + \varepsilon$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Set $N = \max(N_1, N_2)$. For any $n \geq N$, both conditions hold
    simultaneously. Now chain the inequalities:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$L - \varepsilon < a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n < L + \varepsilon$$</div>
  <p>
    The first inequality comes from Step 2. The middle two come from the hypothesis
    $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$. The last comes from Step 3.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 5.</strong> Reading the endpoints: $L - \varepsilon < b_n < L + \varepsilon$,
    which is exactly $|b_n - L| < \varepsilon$.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've shown that for an arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ (namely $\max(N_1, N_2)$)
    such that $|b_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \geq N$. By definition, $\lim b_n = L$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<!-- ─── 9. WHY IT WORKS ────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why the proof works</h2>

<p>
  The entire argument is one chain of inequalities. The outer sequences deliver $a_n$ close to $L$
  from below and $c_n$ close to $L$ from above. The hypothesis $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$ forces
  $b_n$ into the shrinking gap. The gap width is $2\varepsilon$, which we control.
  That's the whole proof.
</p>

<!-- ─── 10. SOLVING THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM ───────────── -->

<h2>Solving the original problem</h2>

<p>
  We can now rigorously finish the problem we started with. Define:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$a_n = \frac{-1}{n}, \quad b_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}, \quad c_n = \frac{1}{n}$$</div>

<p>
  Since $|\sin(n)| \leq 1$, we have $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$ for all $n \geq 1$.
  Both $a_n \to 0$ and $c_n \to 0$. By the squeeze theorem:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sin(n)}{n} = 0$$</div>

<p>
  Done. We never needed to know what $\sin(n)$ does. We only needed to know it's bounded.
</p>

<!-- ─── 11. WHAT BREAKS ────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What breaks</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks if you remove one side?</div>
  <p>
    Suppose you only know $b_n \leq c_n$ with $c_n \to 0$. Does $b_n \to 0$?
  </p>
  <p>
    No. Take $b_n = -1$ for all $n$, and $c_n = 1/n$. Then $b_n \leq c_n$ for all $n \geq 1$
    (since $-1 \leq 1/n$), and $c_n \to 0$. But $b_n \to -1$, not $0$.
    The upper bound alone tells you $b_n$ doesn't escape upward. It says nothing about where
    $b_n$ actually goes. You need both jaws of the vice.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks if the limits differ?</div>
  <p>
    Suppose $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$, but $a_n \to 0$ and $c_n \to 1$. Then $b_n$ is trapped
    in an interval that shrinks to $[0, 1]$. But $b_n$ could converge to any value in $[0, 1]$,
    or oscillate between $0.3$ and $0.7$ forever without converging at all. The trap doesn't close
    to a point, so it can't pin $b_n$ down. The equal-limits hypothesis is what makes the jaws
    meet — without it, there's room to wander.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 12. A HARDER PROBLEM ───────────────────────── -->

<h2>A harder problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">Problem</div>
  <p>
    Prove that $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!}{n^n} = 0$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  This looks difficult. $n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots n$ grows fast — faster than any polynomial.
  And $n^n = n \cdot n \cdot n \cdots n$ ($n$ times) also grows fast. Which wins?
</p>

<p>
  Write out the ratio as a product:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\frac{n!}{n^n} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{2}{n} \cdot \frac{3}{n} \cdots \frac{n}{n}$$</div>

<p>
  Every factor $\frac{k}{n}$ satisfies $0 < \frac{k}{n} \leq 1$ (since $1 \leq k \leq n$).
  The last factor is exactly $1$. But the <em>first</em> factor is $\frac{1}{n}$, which is tiny.
  So the whole product is at most:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$0 < \frac{n!}{n^n} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{2}{n} \cdot \frac{3}{n} \cdots \frac{n}{n}}_{\leq\, 1 \text{ (each factor} \leq 1\text{)}} \leq \frac{1}{n}$$</div>

<p>
  Now squeeze. We have $0 \leq \frac{n!}{n^n} \leq \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \geq 1$.
  The left side is the constant sequence $0$ (limit $0$). The right side is $\frac{1}{n}$ (limit $0$).
  By the squeeze theorem:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!}{n^n} = 0$$</div>

<p>
  Factorials grow fast, but $n^n$ grows faster. The squeeze theorem told us this without computing
  a single value of $n!$ — we just needed the bound.
