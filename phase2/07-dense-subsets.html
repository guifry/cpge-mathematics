<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The paradox</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Over the course of Phase 0 and Phase 2, we've built a paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
    On one hand (page 03 of Phase 0): $\mathbb{Q}$ has holes. $\sqrt{2}$ is missing,
    the IVT fails in $\mathbb{Q}$, Cauchy sequences can converge to nothing.
    You <em>need</em> $\mathbb{R}$ to do analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand: between <em>any</em> two real numbers, there's a rational number.
    And between any two rational numbers, there's an irrational number.
    The rationals are "everywhere" on the number line &mdash; you can approximate any
    real number as closely as you want with fractions.
  </p>
  <p>
    So $\mathbb{Q}$ is simultaneously <strong>full of holes</strong> and
    <strong>everywhere dense</strong>. How can both be true?
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. DEFINITION ──────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>What "dense" means</h2>

<p>
  A set $D \subset \mathbb{R}$ is <strong>dense</strong> in $\mathbb{R}$ if for every
  open interval $(a, b)$ with $a < b$, there exists an element of $D$ in $(a, b)$.
</p>

<p>
  Equivalently: every real number can be approximated arbitrarily well by elements of $D$.
  For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $d \in D$ with
  $|x - d| < \varepsilon$.
</p>

<p>
  The two formulations are the same statement wearing different clothes. The first says
  "no interval is empty of $D$." The second says "no real number is isolated from $D$."
  Pick whichever is more natural for the proof at hand.
</p>

<!-- ─── 3. THEOREM 1 ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The rationals are dense</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem 1 &mdash; Density of $\mathbb{Q}$</div>
  <p>
    $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Between any two distinct real numbers,
    there exists a rational number.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  This is sometimes called a consequence of the <strong>Archimedean property</strong>,
  which states: for any positive real number $\varepsilon$, there exists a natural number
  $n$ with $1/n < \varepsilon$. That sounds obvious, but it's actually a consequence of
  completeness &mdash; it fails in certain ordered fields. We use it here without further comment.
</p>

<!-- ─── 4. PROOF OF THEOREM 1 ──────────────────────── -->

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    Let $a < b$ be real numbers. We need to find a rational $p/q$ with $a < p/q < b$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Choose the denominator.</strong>
    Since $b - a > 0$, the Archimedean property gives us a positive integer $q$ with
    $1/q < b - a$. In other words, the spacing $1/q$ between consecutive multiples of
    $1/q$ is smaller than the width of the interval $(a, b)$.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Choose the numerator.</strong>
    Consider the multiples of $1/q$: $\ldots, -2/q, -1/q, 0, 1/q, 2/q, \ldots$
    These are spaced $1/q$ apart along the real line. Since the interval $(a, b)$ has
    width greater than $1/q$, it must contain at least one of these multiples.
  </p>

  <p>
    Formally: let $p$ be the smallest integer with $p > aq$. Then $p/q > a$. And since
    $p$ is the <em>smallest</em> such integer, we have $p - 1 \leq aq$, so
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{p}{q} = \frac{p-1}{q} + \frac{1}{q} \leq a + \frac{1}{q} < a + (b - a) = b$$</div>
  <p>
    Therefore $a < p/q < b$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<!-- ─── 5. UNPACKING ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why the proof works</h2>

<p>
  The strategy is simple: make the grid fine enough, and the interval can't dodge it.
  Choosing $q$ large enough ensures the rational grid $\{k/q : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
  has spacing smaller than the interval width. Then some grid point <em>must</em> land inside.
</p>

<p>
  Notice we never needed to know what $a$ and $b$ <em>are</em>. They could be irrational,
  transcendental, whatever. The argument works uniformly. That's the power of the Archimedean
  property: no matter how tiny $b - a$ is, you can always find a rational grid fine enough to
  thread a point through it.
</p>

<!-- ─── 6. THEOREM 2 ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The irrationals are dense too</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem 2 &mdash; Density of $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$</div>
  <p>
    The irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Between any two distinct real numbers,
    there exists an irrational number.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 7. PROOF OF THEOREM 2 ──────────────────────── -->

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    Let $a < b$. Consider the shifted interval $(a - \sqrt{2},\; b - \sqrt{2})$.
    By Theorem 1, there exists a rational $r$ with $a - \sqrt{2} < r < b - \sqrt{2}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now set $x = r + \sqrt{2}$. Adding $\sqrt{2}$ to both sides of the inequality gives
    $a < x < b$. And $x$ is irrational, because a rational plus an irrational is always
    irrational (if $r + \sqrt{2}$ were rational, then $\sqrt{2} = (r + \sqrt{2}) - r$
    would be rational, contradicting Phase 0 page 3).
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  This proof is a lovely trick: to find an irrational in $(a, b)$, shift the window into
  $\mathbb{Q}$-territory, find a rational there, then shift back. The irrational $\sqrt{2}$
  acts as a translation that moves every rational to an irrational.
</p>

<!-- ─── 8. THE PARADOX RESOLVED ────────────────────── -->

<h2>Resolving the paradox</h2>

<p>
  So $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense: rationals are everywhere, approximating everything, filling
  every interval. And $\mathbb{Q}$ is incomplete: it has holes where limits fall through.
  How can both be true?
</p>

<p>
  Because <strong>density and completeness are different properties</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Density means "good enough for approximation." For any real number you name, I can find
  a rational as close as you like. Completeness means "good enough for limits." Every
  Cauchy sequence converges, every bounded monotone sequence has a limit, every supremum
  exists. These are not the same demand.
</p>

<p>
  An analogy: think of a mesh net. It covers the whole area &mdash; everywhere you look,
  there's a strand of net nearby. But things fall through the holes. The net is dense
  (it's everywhere) but not complete (it can't hold everything). $\mathbb{Q}$ is the mesh net.
  $\mathbb{R}$ is solid fabric.
</p>

<p>
  Or in sequence language: every real number is the limit of a sequence of rationals (that's
  density), but not every Cauchy sequence of rationals converges <em>within</em> $\mathbb{Q}$
  (that's incompleteness). The sequence $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \ldots$ is Cauchy in
  $\mathbb{Q}$, consists entirely of rationals, but its limit $\sqrt{2}$ is outside
  $\mathbb{Q}$. Dense: every point is approachable. Incomplete: some approaches lead nowhere.
</p>

<!-- ─── 9. WHY DENSITY MATTERS ─────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why density matters for analysis</h2>

<p>
  Density is not a curiosity. It's what makes computation possible.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Decimal expansions work because of density.</strong> Writing $\pi = 3.14159\ldots$
  means constructing a sequence of rationals ($3$, $3.1$, $3.14$, $3.141$, $\ldots$) that
  converges to $\pi$. This is density restated: every real number is the limit of a
  sequence of rationals.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Computers rely on density.</strong> No computer stores $\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$ exactly.
  Every floating-point number is rational. Density guarantees that for any real quantity you
  need, a rational approximation is available and can be made as precise as your hardware allows.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Approximation theory is density in function space.</strong> The Weierstrass
  approximation theorem (Phase 4) says that polynomials &mdash; which use only rational
  arithmetic &mdash; can approximate any continuous function on a closed interval as closely
  as desired. That's the density idea lifted from numbers to functions.
</p>

<!-- ─── 10. HISTORY ────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    The density of $\mathbb{Q}$ was known implicitly since the Greeks. Eudoxus' theory of
    proportions (~370 BC) essentially handles the idea that rationals can approximate any
    magnitude. But the distinction between "dense" and "complete" remained invisible for over
    two thousand years. Mathematicians vaguely assumed $\mathbb{Q}$ was "enough" and only
    encountered trouble occasionally &mdash; $\sqrt{2}$, the irrationality of $\pi$, stubborn
    series that refused to converge to anything rational.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rigorous separation of density from completeness came in the 1870s, when Dedekind and
    Cantor independently formalised the real numbers. Dedekind's construction (cuts) builds
    $\mathbb{R}$ by filling in exactly the holes that density leaves behind. Cantor's
    construction (equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences) makes the same repair from a
    different angle. Both constructions are, in essence, the answer to the paradox on this page:
    $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense but not complete, so we <em>complete</em> it and call the result
    $\mathbb{R}$.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 11. PHASE 1 RECAP ──────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Phase 2 complete &mdash; what you now have</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Completeness</strong>: $\mathbb{R}$ has no holes (page 01)</li>
  <li><strong>Squeeze theorem</strong>: trap and pinch (page 02)</li>
  <li><strong>Monotone convergence</strong>: bounded + monotone $\Rightarrow$ converges (page 03)</li>
  <li><strong>Bolzano&ndash;Weierstrass</strong>: bounded $\Rightarrow$ convergent subsequence (page 04)</li>
  <li><strong>Cauchy criterion</strong>: convergence without knowing the limit (page 05)</li>
  <li><strong>IVT</strong>: continuous functions don't skip values (page 06)</li>
  <li><strong>Dense subsets</strong>: $\mathbb{Q}$ approximates everything but can't hold limits (this page)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are the foundations of analysis. You can reason about limits, convergence, continuity,
  and the structure of the real line. But you can't yet describe <em>how fast things change</em>.
  For that, you need rates of change &mdash; and that's what derivatives are.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Next: Phase 3 &mdash; Calculus.</strong>
</p>

<!-- ─── 12. WHAT BREAKS ────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    If $\mathbb{Q}$ weren't dense, you couldn't approximate real numbers with fractions.
    Decimal expansions wouldn't work. Numerical computation &mdash; everything from pocket
    calculators to finite element simulations &mdash; would be impossible, because every
    computed number is rational and you'd have no guarantee it's close to the real answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, if $\mathbb{Q}$ were dense <em>and</em> complete, it would <em>be</em>
    $\mathbb{R}$. Indeed, the <strong>completion</strong> of $\mathbb{Q}$ &mdash; the smallest
    complete ordered field containing it &mdash; is precisely $\mathbb{R}$. The reals are
    what you get when you take the rationals and demand that limits can't escape.
