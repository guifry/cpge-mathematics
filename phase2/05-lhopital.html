<h1>L'H&ocirc;pital's Rule</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 2 &mdash; Calculus, Page 5</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Compute $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}$. We did this with the squeeze
    theorem (Phase 1 / Phase 2 page 3). It took a geometric argument and careful bounding.
    Now consider:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x}, \qquad \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2}.$$</div>
  <p>
    Substituting $x = 0$ gives $\frac{0}{0}$ in every case &mdash; meaningless. These are
    <em>indeterminate forms</em>: both numerator and denominator vanish, and the value of the
    limit is not determined by this fact alone. Is there a systematic method that handles all
    such forms at once?
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Indeterminate forms</h2>

<p>
  If $f(a) = g(a) = 0$, the expression $f(x)/g(x)$ as $x \to a$ takes the form $0/0$. This
  tells you nothing about the limit. It could be anything:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\frac{\sin x}{x} \to 1, \qquad \frac{x^2}{x} \to 0, \qquad \frac{x}{x^2} \to \infty.$$</div>
<p>
  In each case, both numerator and denominator tend to $0$. The limit depends entirely on
  <em>how fast</em> each function approaches $0$. If the numerator vanishes at roughly the
  same rate as the denominator, the ratio stays finite. If the numerator vanishes faster,
  the ratio tends to $0$. If slower, it blows up.
</p>
<p>
  Rates of change are derivatives. The idea: instead of comparing $f(x)$ and $g(x)$
  directly, compare $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ &mdash; the speeds at which they vanish.
</p>

<h2>2. L'H&ocirc;pital's rule ($0/0$ form)</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; L'H&ocirc;pital's rule ($0/0$)</div>
  <p>
    Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable on an open interval containing $a$, except possibly at
    $a$ itself. Suppose:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$f(a) = g(a) = 0$ (or more precisely, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = 0$),</li>
    <li>$g'(x) \neq 0$ for $x$ near $a$ (except possibly at $a$),</li>
    <li>$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then:</p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    If $f$ or $g$ is not defined at $a$, extend by setting $f(a) = 0$ and $g(a) = 0$. Since
    $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = 0 = f(a)$ and likewise for $g$, both functions are continuous at
    $a$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take any $x \neq a$ in the interval. The functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous on the
    closed interval between $a$ and $x$, and differentiable on its interior. Also $g(x) \neq
    g(a) = 0$ for $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ (because $g'(x) \neq 0$ near $a$ and Rolle's
    theorem would force a zero of $g'$ between any two zeros of $g$). So we may apply
    Cauchy's generalised mean value theorem (page 4): there exists $c$ strictly between $a$
    and $x$ such that
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{g(x) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}.$$</div>
  <p>
    Since $f(a) = g(a) = 0$, this simplifies to
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}.$$</div>
  <p>
    Now let $x \to a$. The point $c$ lies strictly between $a$ and $x$, so $c$ is squeezed
    towards $a$ as well. By hypothesis, $f'(c)/g'(c) \to L$ as $c \to a$. Therefore
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{c \to a} \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} = L.$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The entire proof rests on Cauchy's MVT converting the ratio $f(x)/g(x)$ into the ratio
  $f'(c)/g'(c)$ at a single intermediate point. Everything else is bookkeeping.
</p>

<p>
  A crucial warning: you are <em>not</em> differentiating the quotient $f/g$ using the
  quotient rule. You are replacing $f(x)$ by $f'(x)$ in the numerator and $g(x)$ by $g'(x)$
  in the denominator, independently. The quotient rule would give
  $(f'g - fg')/g^2$ &mdash; a completely different expression. L'H&ocirc;pital's rule is
  not the quotient rule.
</p>

<h2>3. Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}$.</p>
<p>
  Both $\sin 0 = 0$ and the denominator is $0$: this is $0/0$. Differentiate numerator and
  denominator separately:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x}{1} = \cos 0 = 1.$$</div>
<p>
  The same result we proved geometrically &mdash; now obtained mechanically in one line.
</p>

<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2}$.</p>
<p>
  Check: $1 - \cos 0 = 0$ and $0^2 = 0$. Apply L'H&ocirc;pital:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{x^2} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{2x}.$$</div>
<p>
  Still $0/0$. Apply L'H&ocirc;pital again (the conditions hold at each stage):
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.$$</div>
<p>
  You can apply the rule repeatedly, as long as the $0/0$ condition holds at each step.
</p>

<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x}$.</p>
<p>
  Both tend to $0$. Differentiate:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x}{1} = e^0 = 1.$$</div>
<p>
  This uses $\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$, which we have not yet proved. It will come from the
  power series definition of $e^x$ in Phase 3. For now, accept this as a preview of
  L'H&ocirc;pital's reach &mdash; it reduces unknown limits to known derivatives.
</p>

<p><strong>Example 4.</strong> $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x - \sin x}{x^3}$.</p>
<p>
  Check: $0 - 0 = 0$ and $0^3 = 0$. Apply L'H&ocirc;pital:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos x}{3x^2}.$$</div>
<p>
  Still $0/0$. Apply again:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{6x}.$$</div>
<p>
  Still $0/0$. Apply once more:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x}{6} = \frac{1}{6}.$$</div>
<p>
  Three successive applications. At each step, verify that the $0/0$ condition still holds
  before differentiating again. If at any step the form ceases to be indeterminate, stop
  and evaluate directly.
</p>

<h2>4. L'H&ocirc;pital's rule ($\infty/\infty$ form)</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; L'H&ocirc;pital's rule ($\infty/\infty$)</div>
  <p>
    Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable near $a$ (or for $x$ sufficiently large, if $a = \infty$).
    Suppose $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \pm\infty$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \pm\infty$, with
    $g'(x) \neq 0$ near $a$. If
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L,$$</div>
  <p>then $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$.</p>
</div>

<p>
  The full proof is more technical than the $0/0$ case. The standard reduction &mdash; write
  $f/g = (1/g)/(1/f)$ to convert $\infty/\infty$ into $0/0$ &mdash; works in principle but
  has sign subtleties. The cleaner approach proves it directly from Cauchy's MVT applied on
  an interval $[x, x_0]$ where both $f$ and $g$ are large, then lets $x_0 \to a$. We omit
  the details and use the result.
</p>

<h2>5. Example: logarithms grow slowly</h2>

<p>
  $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln x}{x}$.
</p>
<p>
  Both $\ln x \to \infty$ and $x \to \infty$. This is $\infty/\infty$. Differentiate:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln x}{x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1/x}{1} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0.$$</div>
<p>
  Logarithms grow slower than any positive power of $x$. More generally, for any $\alpha > 0$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln x}{x^\alpha} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1/x}{\alpha x^{\alpha - 1}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{\alpha x^\alpha} = 0.$$</div>
<p>
  This uses $\frac{d}{dx}\ln x = 1/x$, which will be derived from the integral of $1/x$
  (page 8) or from the power series of $\ln(1+x)$ (Phase 3).
</p>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>When the derivative ratio has no limit.</strong>
    Consider $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sin x}{x}$. The answer is $1$
    (divide numerator and denominator by $x$: $1 + \frac{\sin x}{x} \to 1$). But
    applying L'H&ocirc;pital gives
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{1 + \cos x}{1},$$</div>
  <p>
    which oscillates between $0$ and $2$ &mdash; no limit exists. L'H&ocirc;pital says:
    <em>if</em> $\lim f'/g'$ exists, <em>then</em> it equals $\lim f/g$. The converse is
    false. The rule failing does not mean the original limit fails.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When the form is not indeterminate.</strong>
    $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$. This is $0/0$, so L'H&ocirc;pital
    applies: $2x/1 \to 2$. Correct, but you could just factor: $(x-1)(x+1)/(x-1) = x+1 \to 2$.
    Don't reach for L'H&ocirc;pital when algebra suffices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When $g'(x) = 0$ near the point.</strong>
    The hypothesis $g'(x) \neq 0$ near $a$ is essential. If $g'$ vanishes at or near $a$,
    the ratio $f'/g'$ is undefined and the rule collapses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Applying to a non-indeterminate form.</strong>
    If $g(a) \neq 0$, then $f(x)/g(x) \to f(a)/g(a)$ by continuity &mdash; no rule needed.
    Blindly differentiating numerator and denominator when the form is not $0/0$ or
    $\infty/\infty$ produces wrong answers. Always check the indeterminate condition first.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>6. When L'H&ocirc;pital fails: a checklist</h2>

<p>
  Before applying the rule, verify all three conditions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Indeterminate form.</strong> Is it genuinely $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$? If the
    denominator has a non-zero limit, just substitute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Differentiability.</strong> Are $f$ and $g$ differentiable near $a$?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Derivative ratio converges.</strong> Does $\lim f'/g'$ exist (or equal
    $\pm\infty$)? If the derivative ratio oscillates, L'H&ocirc;pital is silent &mdash;
    try a different method.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  If all three hold, the rule gives the answer. If any fails, it says nothing &mdash; the
  original limit may still exist, you just need another technique (factoring, conjugates,
  squeeze theorem, Taylor expansion).
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Despite the name, this rule was discovered by Johann Bernoulli around 1694. He
    communicated it to the Marquis de l'H&ocirc;pital, who published it in 1696 in
    <em>Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes</em> &mdash;
    the first calculus textbook ever printed. L'H&ocirc;pital had a contract with Bernoulli:
    an annual salary of 300 livres in exchange for mathematical discoveries, with the right
    to publish them under his own name. The arrangement was legal but ethically dubious. The
    attribution stuck, to Bernoulli's lasting irritation. The correspondence proving
    Bernoulli's priority was published only after both men had died.
