<h1>The Monotone Convergence Theorem</h1>

<!-- ─── 1. THE PROBLEM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Define a sequence by $a_1 = 1$ and
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(a_n + \frac{2}{a_n}\right)$$</div>
  <p>
    This is the <strong>Babylonian method</strong> for computing $\sqrt{2}$. The idea is ancient:
    if $a_n$ is too big (bigger than $\sqrt{2}$), then $2/a_n$ is too small, and their average
    is a better approximation. Let's compute:
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>$n$</th><th>$a_n$</th></tr>
    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$2$</td><td>$1.5$</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$3$</td><td>$1.41\overline{6}$</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$4$</td><td>$1.414215\ldots$</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    By step 4, we already have five correct decimal places of $\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356\ldots$.
    The terms are clearly homing in on $\sqrt{2}$. But <strong>how do you prove
    this sequence converges, without already knowing the limit?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Look at the pattern: after the first step, the terms are <em>decreasing</em>
    ($1.5 > 1.41\overline{6} > 1.414215\ldots$) and <em>positive</em> (bounded below by 0).
    Intuitively, a sequence that keeps going down but can't go below zero must eventually
    settle somewhere. But "must" needs a proof.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 2. DEFINITIONS ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The vocabulary</h2>

<p>
  Before the theorem, we need four definitions. None are deep — they just pin down
  the words precisely.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence $(a_n)$ is <strong>monotone increasing</strong> if $a_{n+1} \geq a_n$
  for all $n$. Each term is at least as big as the one before it. The sequence
  goes up (or stays flat), never dips.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence $(a_n)$ is <strong>monotone decreasing</strong> if $a_{n+1} \leq a_n$
  for all $n$. Each term is at most as big as the one before it. It goes down (or
  stays flat), never rises.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence is <strong>bounded above</strong> if there exists a real number $M$ such
  that $a_n \leq M$ for all $n$. Think of $M$ as a ceiling — no term ever punches
  through it.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence is <strong>bounded below</strong> if there exists a real number $m$ such
  that $a_n \geq m$ for all $n$. Think of $m$ as a floor.
</p>

<p>
  A sequence that is both bounded above and bounded below is simply called
  <strong>bounded</strong>.
</p>

<!-- ─── 3. THE THEOREM ─────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The theorem</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Monotone Convergence Theorem</div>
  <p>
    Every bounded monotone sequence converges. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If $(a_n)$ is increasing and bounded above, then
      $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \sup\{a_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.</li>
    <li>If $(a_n)$ is decreasing and bounded below, then
      $\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \inf\{a_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  The theorem doesn't just say "the limit exists" — it tells you exactly what the limit
  is. An increasing sequence converges to its <strong>supremum</strong> (the least upper
  bound of all its terms). A decreasing sequence converges to its <strong>infimum</strong>
  (the greatest lower bound).
</p>

<!-- ─── 4. WHY COMPLETENESS ────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Why this needs completeness</h2>

<p>
  The proof will use the supremum — the least upper bound of the set of terms. And
  the supremum only exists because $\mathbb{R}$ is <strong>complete</strong> (page 01).
  This isn't a technicality. It's the entire point.
</p>

<p>
  Consider our Babylonian sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}$.
  Every term $a_n$ is rational (you can check: the formula only uses addition,
  division, and multiplication, starting from the integer 1). The sequence is
  bounded and monotone decreasing (after $a_2$). But its limit is $\sqrt{2}$,
  which is <em>not in $\mathbb{Q}$</em>. The sequence is bounded, monotone,
  and <strong>doesn't converge</strong> in $\mathbb{Q}$.
</p>

<p>
  The Monotone Convergence Theorem is <strong>false in $\mathbb{Q}$</strong>.
  What makes it true in $\mathbb{R}$ is completeness — the guarantee that every
  non-empty set bounded above has a supremum. Remove completeness, and the theorem
  collapses. Completeness is doing the work.
</p>

<!-- ─── 5. THE PROOF ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The proof (increasing case)</h2>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>

  <p>
    Let $(a_n)$ be an increasing sequence that is bounded above. We must show it
    converges, and find its limit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Build the set.</strong>
    Let $S = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$ — the set of all terms. $S$ is non-empty
    (it contains at least $a_1$) and bounded above (by hypothesis).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Take the supremum.</strong>
    By the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ (page 01), $L = \sup(S)$ exists.
    This $L$ is a real number. It is an upper bound for $S$
    (meaning $a_n \leq L$ for all $n$), and it is the <em>smallest</em> such
    upper bound.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Step 3. Show $a_n \to L$.</strong>
    Fix any $\varepsilon > 0$, no matter how small. We need to find an $N$ such
    that $|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$ for all $n \geq N$.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since $L$ is the <em>least</em> upper bound, $L - \varepsilon$ is strictly less
    than $L$, so $L - \varepsilon$ is <strong>not</strong> an upper bound for $S$.
    (If it were, $L$ wouldn't be the least one.) Therefore some term exceeds it:
    there exists $N$ such that
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a_N > L - \varepsilon$$</div>

  <p>
    Now use monotonicity: since the sequence is increasing, for all $n \geq N$,
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a_n \geq a_N > L - \varepsilon$$</div>

  <p>
    And since $L$ is an upper bound for $S$,
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$a_n \leq L < L + \varepsilon$$</div>

  <p>
    Combining these two inequalities: for all $n \geq N$,
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$L - \varepsilon < a_n \leq L < L + \varepsilon$$</div>

  <p>
    which means $|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, we have
    $a_n \to L = \sup(S)$.
  </p>

  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The decreasing case is identical, with $\inf$ replacing $\sup$ and all inequalities
  reversed. You can also reduce it to the increasing case by considering $(-a_n)$.
</p>

<!-- ─── 6. UNPACKING ───────────────────────────────── -->

<h2>Unpacking the proof</h2>

<p>
  The key move is in Step 3: "$L - \varepsilon$ is not an upper bound."
  This is the supremum doing its job. The supremum is the <em>tightest possible</em>
  ceiling — anything even slightly lower fails to contain the set. So there must be
  some term $a_N$ that pokes above $L - \varepsilon$.
</p>

<p>
  From that point on, monotonicity takes over. Since the sequence only goes up,
  every term after $a_N$ is at least as large. So the entire tail of the sequence
  is trapped in the corridor $(L - \varepsilon, L]$. It can't escape upward
  (because $L$ is an upper bound) and it can't fall back (because the sequence is
  increasing).
</p>

<p>
  That's it. The supremum provides the target, monotonicity locks the sequence into
  the corridor, and $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary. Three ingredients, one conclusion.
</p>

<!-- ─── 7. HISTORY ─────────────────────────────────── -->

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Euler and the Bernoullis (18th century) freely computed with sequences, assuming
    limits existed whenever the terms "looked like they were settling down." They
    summed divergent series, interchanged limits, and generally treated convergence
    as obvious. It usually worked, because they had good instincts. But sometimes it
    didn't, and then the errors were baffling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Monotone Convergence Theorem was formalised as part of the great
    <strong>rigourisation of analysis</strong> by Bolzano (1817) and Weierstrass
    (1860s). Their programme replaced intuition with proofs: <em>show</em> that the
    limit exists, don't just assume it does because the terms are getting closer
    together. The MCT was a cornerstone of this programme — a clean, checkable
    criterion for convergence that doesn't require you to guess the limit first.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 8. RETURN TO BABYLON ───────────────────────── -->

<h2>Back to the Babylonian method</h2>

<p>
  Now we have the tools to prove the opening problem. The sequence $a_1 = 1$,
  $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(a_n + 2/a_n)$ converges, and its limit is $\sqrt{2}$.
  The proof has four steps.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 1: $a_n > 0$ for all $n$.</strong>
  By induction. $a_1 = 1 > 0$. If $a_n > 0$, then $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(a_n + 2/a_n)$
  is a sum of two positive numbers divided by 2, so $a_{n+1} > 0$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2: $a_n \geq \sqrt{2}$ for $n \geq 2$.</strong>
  By the AM-GM inequality: for any positive $x$,
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\frac{x + 2/x}{2} \geq \sqrt{x \cdot \frac{2}{x}} = \sqrt{2}$$</div>
<p>
  So $a_{n+1} \geq \sqrt{2}$ whenever $a_n > 0$. Since $a_1 > 0$, this gives
  $a_n \geq \sqrt{2}$ for all $n \geq 2$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 3: the sequence is decreasing for $n \geq 2$.</strong>
  We need $a_{n+1} \leq a_n$, i.e.
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\frac{1}{2}\left(a_n + \frac{2}{a_n}\right) \leq a_n$$</div>
<p>
  Rearranging: $2/a_n \leq a_n$, which means $a_n^2 \geq 2$, which is true
  for $n \geq 2$ by Step 2.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 4: apply the MCT and find the limit.</strong>
  The sequence $(a_n)_{n \geq 2}$ is decreasing and bounded below by $\sqrt{2}$.
  By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges to some limit $L$.
</p>

<p>
  To find $L$: take the limit of both sides of the recurrence
  $a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(a_n + 2/a_n)$. Since $a_n \to L$ and $a_{n+1} \to L$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$L = \frac{1}{2}\left(L + \frac{2}{L}\right)$$</div>
<p>
  Multiply both sides by $2L$: $2L^2 = L^2 + 2$, so $L^2 = 2$, giving $L = \sqrt{2}$
  (positive, since all terms are positive).
</p>

<p>
  Notice the structure: the MCT told us <em>the limit exists</em> without us knowing
  what it was. Only afterwards did we identify the limit by solving the fixed-point
  equation. This is the MCT's power — existence first, computation second.
</p>

<!-- ─── 9. WHAT BREAKS: MONOTONE ──────────────────── -->

<h2>What breaks without monotonicity</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    The sequence $a_n = (-1)^n$ is bounded: every term is either $-1$ or $1$, so it
    sits inside $[-1, 1]$. But it's not monotone — it alternates up-down-up-down
    forever. And it doesn't converge. It oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ without
    ever settling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Boundedness alone is not enough. The sequence needs to be headed somewhere — that's
    what monotonicity provides. Without a consistent direction, a bounded sequence can
    wander back and forth inside its bounds indefinitely.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 10. WHAT BREAKS: BOUNDED ─────────────────── -->

<h2>What breaks without boundedness</h2>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    The sequence $a_n = n$ is monotone increasing: $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ — every term
    is larger than the one before. But it's not bounded above. There is no ceiling, so
    it grows without limit. It diverges to infinity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monotonicity alone is not enough. A sequence with a consistent direction but no
    bound just marches off to infinity. The bound is the wall that forces the sequence
    to compress and converge rather than escape.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- ─── 11. THE WORKHORSE ────────────────────────── -->

<h2>The workhorse of convergence proofs</h2>

<p>
  Most convergence proofs you'll encounter in first-year analysis reduce to the MCT.
  The pattern is always the same:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Show the sequence is monotone (usually by induction on $a_{n+1} - a_n$ or $a_{n+1}/a_n$).</li>
  <li>Show it's bounded (usually by induction, or by a clever inequality).</li>
  <li>Conclude: it converges, by the MCT.</li>
  <li>If you want the limit, pass the recurrence to the limit and solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The beauty is that step 3 is free — you don't need to guess the limit, construct
  an $\varepsilon$-$N$ argument, or do anything clever. The MCT hands you convergence
  the moment you've checked two properties. This is why it's called the workhorse:
  it does the heavy lifting so you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
  It's also the reason completeness matters in practice, not just in theory.
  Every time you use the MCT, you're invoking the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$.
  Every time a student writes "bounded and monotone, therefore convergent," the
  supremum axiom is silently at work underneath.
</p>
