<h1>Integration Techniques</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 2 — Calculus, Page 9</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem (page 8) says: to compute $\int_a^b f(x)\, dx$, find an antiderivative
    $G$ with $G' = f$, then evaluate $G(b) - G(a)$. Simple enough in principle. And sometimes in
    practice: $\int x^2\, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C$ because $\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(\frac{x^3}{3}\right) = x^2$.
    You just reverse the power rule.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what about $\int 2x \cos(x^2)\, dx$? Or $\int x e^x\, dx$? Or $\int \sin^2(x)\, dx$?
    None of these match any derivative we know directly. We need systematic methods for finding
    antiderivatives — and the key insight is that those methods come from reading the differentiation
    rules (page 2) backwards. Substitution is the chain rule in reverse. Integration by parts is the
    product rule in reverse. There are no new ideas here — only old ones read through the FTC.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The power rule backwards</h2>

<p>
  The simplest antiderivative formula comes from reversing the power rule for differentiation.
  Since $\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\right) = x^n$, we have immediately:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int x^n\, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \qquad (n \neq -1)$$</div>

<p>
  The "$+ C$" is because the antiderivative is unique only up to an additive constant — a
  consequence of the Mean Value Theorem (page 4): if two functions have the same derivative on
  an interval, they differ by a constant.
</p>

<p>
  The restriction $n \neq -1$ matters: at $n = -1$ the formula gives $\frac{x^0}{0}$, which is
  undefined. This is the one case the power rule doesn't cover, and it requires a separate answer:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \frac{1}{x}\, dx = \ln|x| + C$$</div>

<p>
  (IOU: the natural logarithm will be properly defined via its power series in Phase 3. For now,
  note that this gap in the power rule is precisely what <em>defines</em> the logarithm — it is
  the antiderivative that the power rule cannot produce.)
</p>

<h2>2. Integration by substitution</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Substitution Rule)</div>
  <p>
    Let $g$ be differentiable on $[a,b]$ with continuous derivative $g'$, and let $f$ be
    continuous on the range of $g$. Then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_a^b f\!\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)\, dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)\, du$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Since $f$ is continuous, by the FTC (Part 1, page 8) it has an antiderivative: let $F$
    be a function satisfying $F' = f$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the composite function $F(g(x))$. By the chain rule (page 2):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{d}{dx}\, F\!\big(g(x)\big) = F'\!\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x) = f\!\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)$$</div>
  <p>
    So $F(g(x))$ is an antiderivative of $f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$. Applying the FTC (Part 2):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_a^b f\!\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)\, dx = F\!\big(g(b)\big) - F\!\big(g(a)\big)$$</div>
  <p>
    But $F$ is also an antiderivative of $f$, so applying the FTC again on the right-hand side:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$F\!\big(g(b)\big) - F\!\big(g(a)\big) = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u)\, du$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The intuition: when you see a composite function $f(g(x))$ multiplied by $g'(x)$, the $g'(x)\, dx$
  "becomes" $du$ under the substitution $u = g(x)$. This isn't a formal manipulation of differentials —
  it is the chain rule, which created that $g'(x)$ factor when we differentiated $F(g(x))$, now read
  in reverse. Substitution undoes exactly what the chain rule did.
</p>

<p>
  In practice, you look at the integrand and ask: is there a function composed with something,
  multiplied by the derivative of that something? If so, set $u$ equal to the "inner" function.
  The $g'(x)\, dx$ factor gets absorbed into $du$, leaving a simpler integral in $u$ alone.
  After integrating, substitute back. For definite integrals, you can either substitute back at
  the end or transform the bounds directly (as in example (b) below) — the latter is cleaner.
</p>

<h2>3. Examples of substitution</h2>

<p><strong>Example (a).</strong> Compute $\int 2x \cos(x^2)\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Let $u = x^2$, so $du = 2x\, dx$. The integral becomes:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \cos(u)\, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(x^2) + C$$</div>

<p>
  Verification: $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x^2) = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x$. &#10003;
</p>

<p><strong>Example (b).</strong> Compute $\int_0^1 x\sqrt{1 - x^2}\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Let $u = 1 - x^2$, so $du = -2x\, dx$, hence $x\, dx = -\frac{du}{2}$. The bounds transform:
  when $x = 0$, $u = 1$; when $x = 1$, $u = 0$. The integral becomes:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int_1^0 \sqrt{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 \sqrt{u}\, du = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2}\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$$</div>

<p><strong>Example (c).</strong> Compute $\int \tan(x)\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Write $\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$. Let $u = \cos(x)$, so $du = -\sin(x)\, dx$. Then:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\, dx = -\int \frac{du}{u} = -\ln|u| + C = -\ln|\cos(x)| + C$$</div>

<h2>4. Integration by parts</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem (Integration by Parts)</div>
  <p>
    Let $u$ and $v$ be differentiable on $[a,b]$ with continuous derivatives. Then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_a^b u(x) \cdot v'(x)\, dx = \Big[u(x)\, v(x)\Big]_a^b - \int_a^b u'(x) \cdot v(x)\, dx$$</div>
  <p>
    In shorthand: $\int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    By the product rule (page 2):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{d}{dx}\Big[u(x)\, v(x)\Big] = u'(x)\, v(x) + u(x)\, v'(x)$$</div>
  <p>
    Integrate both sides from $a$ to $b$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_a^b \frac{d}{dx}\Big[u(x)\, v(x)\Big]\, dx = \int_a^b u'(x)\, v(x)\, dx + \int_a^b u(x)\, v'(x)\, dx$$</div>
  <p>
    By the FTC (Part 2), the left side evaluates to $\Big[u(x)\, v(x)\Big]_a^b$. Rearranging:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_a^b u(x)\, v'(x)\, dx = \Big[u(x)\, v(x)\Big]_a^b - \int_a^b u'(x)\, v(x)\, dx$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The strategy: integration by parts trades one integral for another. You split the integrand
  into $u$ (which you will differentiate) and $dv$ (which you will integrate). The hope is that
  the new integral $\int v\, du$ is simpler than the original $\int u\, dv$. The art lies in
  choosing $u$ and $dv$ so that differentiating $u$ simplifies it, and integrating $dv$ doesn't
  make things worse.
</p>

<h2>5. Examples of integration by parts</h2>

<p><strong>Example (a).</strong> Compute $\int x e^x\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Choose $u = x$ (differentiating simplifies it to $1$) and $dv = e^x\, dx$ (integrating keeps it
  as $e^x$). Then $du = dx$ and $v = e^x$.
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int x e^x\, dx = x e^x - \int e^x\, dx = x e^x - e^x + C = e^x(x - 1) + C$$</div>

<p>
  Verification: $\frac{d}{dx}\big[e^x(x-1)\big] = e^x(x-1) + e^x = xe^x$. &#10003;
</p>

<p><strong>Example (b).</strong> Compute $\int \ln(x)\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Choose $u = \ln(x)$ and $dv = dx$. Then $du = \frac{1}{x}\, dx$ and $v = x$.
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \ln(x)\, dx = x\ln(x) - \int x \cdot \frac{1}{x}\, dx = x\ln(x) - \int dx = x\ln(x) - x + C$$</div>

<p>
  (IOU on $\ln$ as before — Phase 3 will ground it via power series.)
</p>

<p><strong>Example (c).</strong> Compute $\int \sin^2(x)\, dx$.</p>

<p>
  Choose $u = \sin(x)$, $dv = \sin(x)\, dx$. Then $du = \cos(x)\, dx$, $v = -\cos(x)$.
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \sin^2(x)\, dx = -\sin(x)\cos(x) + \int \cos^2(x)\, dx$$</div>

<p>
  The new integral looks no simpler — but use the identity $\cos^2(x) = 1 - \sin^2(x)$:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$\int \sin^2(x)\, dx = -\sin(x)\cos(x) + \int \big(1 - \sin^2(x)\big)\, dx = -\sin(x)\cos(x) + x - \int \sin^2(x)\, dx$$</div>

<p>
  The original integral has reappeared on the right. Call it $I$:
</p>

<div class="display-math">$$I = -\sin(x)\cos(x) + x - I$$</div>

<div class="display-math">$$2I = x - \sin(x)\cos(x)$$</div>

<div class="display-math">$$I = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{\sin(2x)}{4} + C$$</div>

<p>
  (using the double-angle identity $\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)$). This trick — applying
  integration by parts and then solving algebraically for the original integral — is a standard
  technique, not a one-off coincidence.
</p>

<h2>6. Differentiation rules read backwards</h2>

<p>
  Every integration technique we have seen is a differentiation rule from page 2, reversed
  through the FTC:

</table>

<p>
  There are no "new" ideas in integration techniques. Every method is an old idea —
  a differentiation rule — read backwards through the Fundamental Theorem. The difficulty of
  integration is not conceptual but tactical: recognising which rule to read backwards, and
  choosing the right decomposition of the integrand.
</p>

<h2>7. Phase 2 recap</h2>

<p>
  In nine pages we built calculus from scratch:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The derivative, from the tangent problem and the limit definition.</li>
  <li>Differentiation rules — sum, product, quotient, chain — proved from that definition.</li>
  <li>Trigonometric derivatives, proved geometrically from the unit circle.</li>
  <li>The Mean Value Theorem, connecting derivatives to function behaviour.</li>
  <li>L'H&ocirc;pital's rule, turning the MVT into a limit-computation tool.</li>
  <li>The Riemann integral, from Archimedes' area problem and the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$.</li>
  <li>Integrability — which functions have a well-defined integral.</li>
  <li>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus — the single deepest result in the subject, connecting
      derivatives and integrals.</li>
  <li>Integration techniques — differentiation rules read backwards through the FTC.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Every formula was derived. Every theorem was proved. Nothing was assumed from lyc&eacute;e or
  taken on faith.
</p>

<p>
  Phase 3 (Taylor series and power series) will use both derivatives and integrals heavily.
  Taylor's theorem requires repeated differentiation. The integral form of the remainder requires
  integration by parts. Power series define $e^x$, $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\ln$ rigorously — finally
  paying off the IOUs accumulated across Phase 2. All of this now stands on solid ground.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Both the substitution rule and integration by parts were known to Euler (1730s-1760s) and used
    extensively by the Bernoulli family. They treated these as algebraic manipulations of
    "infinitesimals" — $dx$, $du$ — without worrying about rigour. The formal proofs we gave,
    deriving both rules from the FTC and the differentiation rules, are essentially Cauchy's approach
    from his 1823 <em>R&eacute;sum&eacute; des le&ccedil;ons</em>. Cauchy was the first to bother
    <em>proving</em> these "obvious" manipulations — and in doing so, he discovered that they require
    hypotheses (continuity of $g'$ for substitution, differentiability of both $u$ and $v$ for parts)
    that the infinitesimal heuristics had silently assumed.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Substitution without continuous $g'$:</strong> the proof uses the FTC to evaluate
    $\int_a^b \frac{d}{dx}F(g(x))\, dx$, which requires $F'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$ to be Riemann
    integrable. If $g'$ is not continuous, the composite $f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$ may fail to be
    integrable, and the substitution formula breaks down.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Integration by parts with a bad choice of $u$ and $dv$:</strong> the formula is always
    <em>true</em> (it's a theorem, not a heuristic), but a poor choice makes the new integral
    harder than the original. For instance, choosing $u = e^x$ and $dv = x\, dx$ in
    $\int x e^x\, dx$ gives $\int \frac{x^2}{2} e^x\, dx$ — a true equation but a useless one.
    There is no algorithm for choosing the right split; it is a skill developed through practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Functions with no elementary antiderivative:</strong> some integrands — $e^{-x^2}$,
    $\frac{\sin x}{x}$, $\frac{1}{\ln x}$ — have no antiderivative expressible in terms of
    elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and their
    compositions). No amount of substitution or parts will help. The integral exists (the FTC
    guarantees it for continuous functions) but cannot be written in closed form. These integrals
    require either numerical methods or new named functions (the error function $\operatorname{erf}$,
    the sine integral $\operatorname{Si}$, etc.).
