<h1>Power Series and Radius of Convergence</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 4 &mdash; Power Series and Taylor, Page 2</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    On <a href="01-taylor-theorem.html">page 1</a> we saw that the Taylor polynomial of $e^x$
    at $a = 0$ is $1 + x + x^2/2! + \cdots + x^n/n!$. As $n \to \infty$, we get an infinite
    series. But does this infinite sum converge? And for which values of $x$?
  </p>
  <p>
    More generally, given a <strong>power series</strong> $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with
    fixed coefficients $a_n$, for which $x$ does the series converge? The answer turns out to
    be beautifully simple: there is a number $R$ (the <strong>radius of convergence</strong>)
    such that the series converges for $|x| < R$ and diverges for $|x| > R$. The geometry is
    a disc centred at the origin. But the value of $R$ can be surprising.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The geometric series: the prototype</h2>

<p>
  The simplest power series is the geometric series. For $|x| < 1$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}$$</div>
<p>
  We can verify this directly. The partial sum $S_N = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^N$ satisfies
  $S_N(1 - x) = 1 - x^{N+1}$, so $S_N = \frac{1 - x^{N+1}}{1 - x}$. When $|x| < 1$,
  $x^{N+1} \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$
  (<a href="../phase2/02-squeeze-theorem.html">Phase 2, page 2</a>), giving $S_N \to 1/(1-x)$.
  When $|x| > 1$, $|x^{N+1}| \to \infty$ and the partial sums diverge. At $|x| = 1$, the
  terms do not tend to zero, so the series diverges.
</p>
<p>
  The radius of convergence is $R = 1$. Inside the disc $|x| < 1$: convergence. Outside: divergence.
  This pattern holds for every power series.
</p>

<h2>2. Power series: definition</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Power series</div>
  <p>
    A <strong>power series centred at $a$</strong> is an expression of the form:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (x - a)^n = a_0 + a_1(x-a) + a_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots$$</div>
  <p>
    where $(a_n)$ is a fixed sequence of real numbers (the <strong>coefficients</strong>) and
    $x$ is a variable. When $a = 0$, this simplifies to $\sum a_n x^n$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  A power series is a function of $x$ &mdash; but only for those $x$ where the series converges.
  Its <strong>domain</strong> is the set of all $x$ for which $\sum a_n (x-a)^n$ converges.
  We now determine this domain.
</p>

<h2>3. The key lemma</h2>

<p>
  The following lemma shows that convergence at one point forces convergence everywhere closer
  to the centre:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Lemma</div>
  <p>
    If $\sum a_n r^n$ converges for some $r \neq 0$, then $\sum a_n x^n$ converges absolutely
    for every $x$ with $|x| < |r|$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Since $\sum a_n r^n$ converges, its terms tend to zero
    (<a href="../phase2/05-cauchy-criterion.html">Phase 2, page 5</a>). In particular, the
    sequence $(a_n r^n)$ is bounded: there exists $M > 0$ with $|a_n r^n| \leq M$ for all $n$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> For $|x| < |r|$, let $\rho = |x/r| < 1$. Then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$|a_n x^n| = |a_n r^n| \cdot \left|\frac{x}{r}\right|^n \leq M \rho^n$$</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> The series $\sum M \rho^n = M/(1-\rho)$ is a convergent geometric
    series (since $\rho < 1$). By comparison, $\sum |a_n x^n|$ converges.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The contrapositive is equally useful: if $\sum a_n x^n$ diverges at some $x_0$, then it
  diverges for all $x$ with $|x| > |x_0|$. Convergence is "closer to the centre" and
  divergence is "farther away."
</p>

<h2>4. The radius of convergence</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Radius of convergence</div>
  <p>
    For any power series $\sum a_n x^n$, there exists a number $R \in [0, \infty]$ such that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The series converges absolutely for $|x| < R$.</li>
    <li>The series diverges for $|x| > R$.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    $R$ is called the <strong>radius of convergence</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Define $R = \sup\{|r| : \sum a_n r^n \text{ converges}\}$ (with $R = \infty$ if the set is
    unbounded). This supremum exists by the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$
    (<a href="../phase2/01-completeness.html">Phase 2, page 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    If $|x| < R$: by the definition of supremum, there exists $r$ with $|x| < |r| \leq R$ and
    $\sum a_n r^n$ convergent. The lemma gives absolute convergence at $x$.
  </p>
  <p>
    If $|x| > R$: the series cannot converge at $x$, for otherwise the lemma would force
    convergence at all points inside $|x|$, contradicting $R$ being the supremum.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  At $|x| = R$ (the boundary), anything can happen &mdash; the series may converge, diverge,
  or converge conditionally. Each boundary point must be checked individually.
  <a href="06-abel-theorem.html">Page 6</a> will say more about this.
</p>

<h2>5. Computing $R$: the ratio test</h2>

<p>
  For most concrete series, $R$ can be computed from the coefficients. The ratio test from
  d'Alembert (which we state here and will prove in full generality in Phase 5) gives:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Formula &mdash; Ratio test for radius</div>
  <p>
    If the limit exists:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right|$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  The idea: $\sum a_n x^n$ behaves like a geometric series with ratio
  $|a_{n+1} x^{n+1}| / |a_n x^n| = |a_{n+1}/a_n| \cdot |x|$. This ratio is less than $1$
  (convergence) when $|x| < |a_n/a_{n+1}|$, and the limit of this bound is $R$.
</p>

<h2>6. Computing $R$: the root test (Cauchy-Hadamard)</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Formula &mdash; Cauchy-Hadamard</div>
  <p>
    The radius of convergence is:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{1}{R} = \limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n}$$</div>
  <p>
    (with $1/R = 0$ meaning $R = \infty$, and $1/R = \infty$ meaning $R = 0$).
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The Cauchy-Hadamard formula always works (it uses $\limsup$, which always exists for a
  bounded-above sequence), whereas the ratio test requires the limit of $|a_n/a_{n+1}|$ to
  exist. For most textbook examples, either formula gives the same answer.
</p>

<h2>7. Examples</h2>

<p>
  <strong>The exponential series</strong> $\sum x^n / n!$. Using the ratio test:
  $|a_n / a_{n+1}| = |(1/n!) / (1/(n+1)!)| = n + 1 \to \infty$. So $R = \infty$ &mdash; the
  series converges for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The geometric series</strong> $\sum x^n$. Here $a_n = 1$, so
  $|a_n/a_{n+1}| = 1$. Thus $R = 1$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The series</strong> $\sum n! \, x^n$. Using the ratio test:
  $|a_n/a_{n+1}| = n!/(n+1)! = 1/(n+1) \to 0$. So $R = 0$: the series converges only at
  $x = 0$. The coefficients grow so fast that the series never converges elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The series</strong> $\sum x^n / n$. Here $|a_n/a_{n+1}| = (n+1)/n \to 1$, so $R = 1$.
  At $x = 1$: $\sum 1/n$ diverges (the harmonic series). At $x = -1$: $\sum (-1)^n/n$ converges
  (by the alternating series test, which we will prove in Phase 5; for now, note it converges
  to $\ln 2$, as <a href="06-abel-theorem.html">page 6</a> will show).
</p>

<h2>8. The mystery of $1/(1 + x^2)$</h2>

<p>
  Consider $f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2)$. This function is perfectly smooth on all of $\mathbb{R}$
  &mdash; no discontinuities, no corners, infinitely differentiable everywhere. Its Taylor
  series at $a = 0$ is:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\frac{1}{1+x^2} = 1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n}$$</div>
<p>
  (obtained by substituting $-x^2$ for $x$ in the geometric series $1/(1-x) = \sum x^n$).
  This is a geometric series with ratio $-x^2$, so it converges when $|{-x^2}| < 1$, i.e.
  $|x| < 1$. The radius of convergence is $R = 1$.
</p>
<p>
  But <em>why</em>? The function $1/(1+x^2)$ is smooth at $x = 2$, at $x = 10$, everywhere.
  There is no singularity on the real line. Why does the Taylor series refuse to converge
  beyond $|x| = 1$?
</p>
<p>
  The answer is invisible from the real line but obvious in the complex plane: $1/(1+z^2)$
  has poles at $z = i$ and $z = -i$ (where $1 + z^2 = 0$). The distance from the centre
  $a = 0$ to the nearest singularity is $|i| = 1$. The radius of convergence equals the
  distance to the nearest <em>complex</em> singularity, even when you only care about real $x$.
</p>
<p>
  This is Hadamard's insight: the power series "sees" the complex plane. Real smoothness is
  not enough &mdash; the series reaches out into $\mathbb{C}$ and hits the pole at $\pm i$.
  A full explanation requires complex analysis, but the principle is worth stating now: the
  radius of convergence of a Taylor series equals the distance from the centre to the nearest
  complex singularity of the function.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Cauchy (1821) first studied the convergence of power series systematically. He understood
    that $\sum a_n x^n$ converges inside a disc and diverges outside, but did not give a
    formula for $R$. Hadamard (1892) proved the root test formula $1/R = \limsup |a_n|^{1/n}$,
    which always works and is now called the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem (Cauchy having discovered
    a special case earlier).
  </p>
  <p>
    The complex-plane explanation for the radius of convergence &mdash; that $R$ equals the
    distance to the nearest singularity in $\mathbb{C}$ &mdash; was understood by Weierstrass
    and Hadamard in the late 19th century. It is one of the most compelling arguments for why
    complex numbers are "real": they explain phenomena about real-valued functions that are
    invisible from the real line alone.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>At the boundary $|x| = R$:</strong> convergence is not guaranteed. The series
    $\sum x^n$ (radius $R = 1$) diverges at both $x = 1$ and $x = -1$. The series $\sum x^n/n$
    (also $R = 1$) diverges at $x = 1$ but converges at $x = -1$. The series $\sum x^n/n^2$
    (also $R = 1$) converges at both boundary points. The radius tells you nothing about the
    boundary &mdash; each endpoint is its own problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without absolute convergence inside:</strong> inside $|x| < R$, convergence is
    always <em>absolute</em> (the lemma proved it via comparison with a geometric series). This
    is important: absolutely convergent series can be rearranged freely without changing the sum
    (conditional convergence allows rearrangement to any value, as Riemann showed). Inside the
    radius, power series are well-behaved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When $R = 0$:</strong> the series $\sum n!\, x^n$ converges only at $x = 0$. The
    coefficients grow so explosively that no nonzero $x$ can tame them. Such a series is
    essentially useless as a function &mdash; it defines nothing beyond a single point.
  </p>
