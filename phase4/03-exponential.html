<h1>The Exponential Function</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 4 &mdash; Power Series and Taylor, Page 3</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    A quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its current size. A population of
    bacteria that doubles every hour. Money earning continuous compound interest. Radioactive
    atoms decaying at a rate proportional to how many remain. All of these are governed by the
    equation $y' = y$ &mdash; the simplest differential equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need a function that equals its own derivative. No polynomial works (differentiating a
    polynomial lowers its degree). No trigonometric function works ($\sin' = \cos \neq \sin$).
    But an <em>infinite</em> polynomial can work: if you choose the coefficients carefully, the
    power series can reproduce itself under differentiation. That function is $e^x$, and we
    define it here from scratch.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Constructing the series</h2>

<p>
  We want $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with $f' = f$ and $f(0) = 1$ (a normalisation:
  starting with one bacterium, one pound, one atom). Differentiating the series term by term
  (which we will justify on <a href="05-term-by-term.html">page 5</a>):
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+1) a_{n+1} x^n$$</div>
<p>
  Setting $f' = f$ means $(n+1)a_{n+1} = a_n$ for all $n$, so $a_{n+1} = a_n/(n+1)$. Starting
  from $a_0 = f(0) = 1$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$a_0 = 1, \quad a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad a_3 = \frac{1}{6}, \quad \ldots, \quad a_n = \frac{1}{n!}$$</div>
<p>
  The recurrence $a_{n+1} = a_n/(n+1)$ with $a_0 = 1$ gives $a_n = 1/n!$ by induction. The
  coefficients are forced &mdash; there is no freedom in the choice.
</p>

<h2>2. Definition</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; The exponential function</div>
  <p>
    The <strong>exponential function</strong> is defined by:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  This is a <em>definition</em>, not a derivation. We are defining $\exp$ as this power series,
  and we will prove all its properties from the series. No prior knowledge of "$e$" or
  "exponential growth" is assumed.
</p>

<h2>3. Convergence: $R = \infty$</h2>

<p>
  By the ratio test (<a href="02-power-series.html">page 2, section 5</a>):
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$R = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right| = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1/n!}{1/(n+1)!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (n+1) = \infty$$</div>
<p>
  The series converges absolutely for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The factorial in the
  denominator grows so much faster than $x^n$ in the numerator that the terms tend to zero
  regardless of $x$.
</p>

<h2>4. The Taylor remainder vanishes</h2>

<p>
  We must verify that the series actually equals the function it claims to represent. On
  <a href="01-taylor-theorem.html">page 1</a> we saw that Taylor series can fail to converge
  to $f$. Here we must show $R_n(x) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$.
</p>
<p>
  Using the Lagrange remainder: if $f(x) = \exp(x)$, then $f^{(n+1)}(c) = \exp(c)$ for some
  $c$ between $0$ and $x$. On the interval $[0, x]$ (or $[x, 0]$), $|\exp(c)| \leq \exp(|x|)$.
  So:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$|R_n(x)| \leq \frac{\exp(|x|)}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1}$$</div>
<p>
  For fixed $x$, $|x|^{n+1}/(n+1)! \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ (the factorial beats any fixed
  power). Therefore $R_n(x) \to 0$, confirming that the Taylor series converges to $\exp(x)$
  for every $x$. This argument is not circular: $\exp(|x|)$ is a fixed constant once $x$ is
  chosen, and the factorial still dominates.
</p>

<h2>5. The functional equation: $\exp(a + b) = \exp(a) \cdot \exp(b)$</h2>

<p>
  This is the property that makes the exponential an <em>exponential</em> &mdash; it converts
  addition to multiplication. The proof uses the Cauchy product of series.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Functional equation</div>
  <p>
    For all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$: $\exp(a + b) = \exp(a) \cdot \exp(b)$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Expand $\exp(a+b)$.</strong>
    By definition:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\exp(a+b) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(a+b)^n}{n!}$$</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Apply the binomial theorem.</strong>
    $(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k}$. Substituting:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\exp(a+b) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a^k}{k!} \cdot \frac{b^{n-k}}{(n-k)!}$$</div>
  <p>
    (using $\binom{n}{k}/n! = 1/(k!(n-k)!)$).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 3. Recognise the Cauchy product.</strong>
    The double sum above is exactly the Cauchy product of $\sum a^k/k!$ and $\sum b^j/j!$.
    Since both series converge absolutely (radius $\infty$), the Cauchy product equals the
    product of the sums:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\exp(a+b) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{a^k}{k!}\right) \cdot \left(\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{b^j}{j!}\right) = \exp(a) \cdot \exp(b)$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<h2>6. Immediate consequences</h2>

<p>
  From the functional equation alone, we get a cascade of properties:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>$\exp(0) = 1$.</strong> Set $b = 0$: $\exp(a) = \exp(a+0) = \exp(a) \cdot \exp(0)$.
  Since $\exp(a) \neq 0$ (which we prove next), divide both sides by $\exp(a)$.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>$\exp(x) > 0$ for all $x$.</strong> For $x \geq 0$: the series $1 + x + x^2/2 +
  \cdots$ is a sum of non-negative terms starting with $1$, so it is at least $1 > 0$. For
  $x < 0$: $\exp(x) \cdot \exp(-x) = \exp(0) = 1$, so $\exp(x) = 1/\exp(-x) > 0$ (since
  $-x > 0$).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>$\exp(-x) = 1/\exp(x)$.</strong> Immediate from the line above.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>$\exp$ is strictly increasing.</strong> For $x > 0$: $\exp(x) = 1 + x + \cdots > 1$.
  If $a < b$, then $\exp(b) = \exp(a) \cdot \exp(b-a) > \exp(a) \cdot 1 = \exp(a)$.
</p>

<h2>7. $\exp'(x) = \exp(x)$</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem</div>
  <p>
    $\exp'(x) = \exp(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Differentiate the series term by term (justified on
    <a href="05-term-by-term.html">page 5</a>; the series has infinite radius, so
    term-by-term differentiation is valid everywhere):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\exp'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n x^{n-1}}{n!} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^m}{m!} = \exp(x)$$</div>
  <p>
    (substituting $m = n - 1$).
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  This is the property we designed the series to have. But now it is a <em>theorem</em>, not an
  assumption: $\exp$ is defined by its series, and the derivative identity follows from
  term-by-term differentiation.
</p>

<h2>8. The number $e$</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Euler's number</div>
  <p>
    $e = \exp(1) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \cdots \approx 2.71828$
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The notation $e^x$ for $\exp(x)$ is justified: $\exp(n) = \exp(1)^n = e^n$ for positive
  integers $n$ (by applying the functional equation $n$ times). For rational $x = p/q$,
  $\exp(p/q)$ satisfies $(\exp(p/q))^q = \exp(p) = e^p$, so $\exp(p/q) = e^{p/q}$. For
  irrational $x$, continuity of $\exp$ (it is differentiable, hence continuous) extends this
  to all of $\mathbb{R}$.
</p>

<h2>9. The natural logarithm</h2>

<p>
  Since $\exp$ is strictly increasing and continuous, with $\exp(x) \to 0$ as $x \to -\infty$
  and $\exp(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem
  (<a href="../phase2/06-ivt.html">Phase 2, page 6</a>) ensures that $\exp$ hits every
  positive real number exactly once. It therefore has an inverse:
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Natural logarithm</div>
  <p>
    The <strong>natural logarithm</strong> $\ln : (0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ is the inverse
    of $\exp$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\ln(y) = x \iff \exp(x) = y$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  Its properties follow from inverting the exponential's properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>$\ln(1) = 0$ (because $\exp(0) = 1$).</li>
  <li>$\ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$ (because $\exp(\ln a + \ln b) = \exp(\ln a)\exp(\ln b) = ab$).</li>
  <li>$\ln'(y) = 1/y$ (by the inverse function theorem:
      $\ln'(y) = 1/\exp'(\ln y) = 1/\exp(\ln y) = 1/y$).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This closes the IOU from <a href="../phase3/09-integration-techniques.html">Phase 3, page 9</a>:
  $\int 1/x\, dx = \ln|x| + C$ is now grounded, because $\ln$ is rigorously defined as the
  inverse of $\exp$, and $\ln' = 1/x$ is proved.
</p>

<h2>10. The limit definition of $e$</h2>

<p>
  There is a classical alternative formula: $e = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n$. We can
  derive this from the series.
</p>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Derivation</div>
  <p>
    By the binomial theorem:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \frac{1}{n^k}$$</div>
  <p>
    The $k$-th term is:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\binom{n}{k}\frac{1}{n^k} = \frac{1}{k!} \cdot \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{n^k} = \frac{1}{k!}\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}\left(1 - \frac{j}{n}\right)$$</div>
  <p>
    As $n \to \infty$ with $k$ fixed, each factor $(1 - j/n) \to 1$, so the $k$-th term tends
    to $1/k!$. Summing over all $k$: the limit is $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 1/k! = e$.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Making this rigorous requires bounding the error from the finite truncation; the monotone
    convergence theorem from
    <a href="../phase2/03-monotone-convergence.html">Phase 2, page 3</a> shows the sequence
    $(1 + 1/n)^n$ is increasing and bounded by $e$.)
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Jacob Bernoulli (1683) discovered the limit $(1 + 1/n)^n$ while studying compound interest:
    if a bank pays $100\%$ interest per year, compounded $n$ times, you end the year with
    $(1 + 1/n)^n$ times your deposit. As $n \to \infty$ (continuous compounding), this
    approaches $e \approx 2.718$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Euler (1748) was the first to study the exponential function systematically, computing $e$
    to many decimal places and establishing the notation $e^x$. He derived the series
    $e^x = \sum x^n/n!$ and proved the functional equation. The rigorous definition of $\exp$
    via its power series, with convergence properties proved from first principles, is the
    modern approach due to Cauchy and Weierstrass.

</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Without absolute convergence:</strong> the functional equation proof uses the Cauchy
    product, which requires absolute convergence of both series. Conditionally convergent series
    can give wrong answers when multiplied term by term (Riemann's rearrangement theorem). The
    infinite radius of $\exp$ ensures absolute convergence everywhere, making all algebraic
    manipulations of the series safe.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the factorial:</strong> if we defined $g(x) = \sum x^n$ (no factorial
    denominators), the series would converge only for $|x| < 1$ (the geometric series) and
    would not satisfy $g' = g$. The factorials are not decorative &mdash; they are precisely
    what makes $\exp' = \exp$ and gives infinite radius.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without uniqueness of the power series:</strong> we showed that the recurrence
    $a_{n+1} = a_n/(n+1)$ with $a_0 = 1$ forces $a_n = 1/n!$. But does the differential
    equation $y' = y$, $y(0) = 1$ have other solutions that are not power series? It does not
    (the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem from Phase 8 will prove this). For now: the power series
    definition gives a specific, well-defined function, and all its properties are proved from
    the series alone.
