<h1>Sine and Cosine from Scratch</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 4 &mdash; Power Series and Taylor, Page 4</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    In <a href="../phase0/04-trigonometry.html">Phase 0</a> we defined sine and cosine
    geometrically: ratios in a right triangle, then coordinates on the unit circle. In
    <a href="../phase3/03-trig-derivatives.html">Phase 3</a> we proved their derivatives using
    a geometric squeeze argument. Both approaches rely on geometry &mdash; angles, arcs, the
    unit circle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we do something remarkable: define sine and cosine <strong>purely from
    arithmetic</strong>. No geometry, no unit circle, no angles. Just power series &mdash;
    infinite polynomials whose coefficients are determined by the same derivative-matching logic
    as on <a href="01-taylor-theorem.html">page 1</a>. From these series alone, we will prove
    $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, that $|\sin x| \leq 1$, and that $(\sin x)' = \cos x$. Every
    IOU from Phases 0&ndash;3 gets paid in full.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The power series definitions</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Sine and cosine</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots$$</div>
</div>

<p>
  Why these coefficients? They are forced by the same logic as the exponential. We want
  $\sin'' = -\sin$ and $\cos'' = -\cos$ (the equation of harmonic oscillation), with initial
  conditions $\sin(0) = 0$, $\sin'(0) = 1$, $\cos(0) = 1$, $\cos'(0) = 0$. Matching
  derivatives at $0$ term by term yields exactly these series.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively: these are the Taylor series at $a = 0$ of the geometric $\sin$ and $\cos$,
  computed from their cycling derivatives ($\sin, \cos, -\sin, -\cos, \sin, \ldots$) evaluated
  at $0$. The all-zero even derivatives of $\sin$ kill the even powers; the all-zero odd
  derivatives of $\cos$ kill the odd powers.
</p>

<h2>2. Convergence: $R = \infty$</h2>

<p>
  Both series have infinite radius of convergence. For $\sin$, the non-zero coefficients are
  $a_{2n+1} = (-1)^n/(2n+1)!$. The ratio test gives:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\left|\frac{a_{2n+1}}{a_{2n+3}}\right| = \frac{(2n+3)!}{(2n+1)!} = (2n+2)(2n+3) \to \infty$$</div>
<p>
  So $R = \infty$. The same argument applies to $\cos$. Both series converge absolutely for
  every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, just like $\exp$.
</p>

<h2>3. Taylor remainder vanishes</h2>

<p>
  For $\sin$: the $(n+1)$-th derivative of $\sin$ is one of $\pm\sin$ or $\pm\cos$, so
  $|f^{(n+1)}(c)| \leq 1$ for all $c$ (once we prove $|\sin| \leq 1$ and $|\cos| \leq 1$,
  which follows from section 5 below). The Lagrange remainder satisfies:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$|R_n(x)| \leq \frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0$$</div>
<p>
  So the Taylor series converges to $\sin(x)$ for every $x$. The same holds for $\cos$.
</p>
<p>
  To avoid circularity (we use $|\sin| \leq 1$ to prove the remainder vanishes, but that
  bound comes from $\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1$, which we prove next purely from the series), note
  that section 5 below is entirely algebraic and does not use the remainder estimate. We first
  prove $\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1$ from the series, which gives $|\sin| \leq 1$, and <em>then</em>
  use that bound to confirm the remainder vanishes.
</p>

<h2>4. Derivatives from the series</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem</div>
  <p>
    $\sin'(x) = \cos(x)$ and $\cos'(x) = -\sin(x)$ for all $x$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Differentiate $\sin$ term by term (justified on <a href="05-term-by-term.html">page 5</a>;
    the radius is infinite):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\sin'(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (2n+1)}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} = \cos(x)$$</div>
  <p>
    Similarly, differentiating $\cos$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\cos'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (2n)}{(2n)!} x^{2n-1} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n-1)!} x^{2n-1}$$</div>
  <p>
    Substituting $m = n - 1$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$= \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{m+1}}{(2m+1)!} x^{2m+1} = -\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{(2m+1)!} x^{2m+1} = -\sin(x)$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  This confirms what we proved geometrically in
  <a href="../phase3/03-trig-derivatives.html">Phase 3, page 3</a>. But now the proof is
  purely algebraic &mdash; no unit circle, no geometric squeeze, no $\lim \sin(h)/h = 1$.
  The series <em>is</em> the definition, and the derivative follows from the algebra of the
  series.
</p>

<h2>5. The Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$</h2>

<p>
  This is the central result of this page. We prove it entirely from the series, with no
  geometry.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Pythagorean identity</div>
  <p>
    For all $x \in \mathbb{R}$: $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Define $g(x) = \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Differentiate using the chain rule
    (<a href="../phase3/02-differentiation-rules.html">Phase 3, page 2</a>):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$g'(x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x) + 2\cos(x)(-\sin(x)) = 0$$</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 3.</strong> By the MVT corollary
    (<a href="../phase3/04-mean-value-theorem.html">Phase 3, page 4</a>), a function with
    zero derivative on $\mathbb{R}$ is constant. So $g(x) = g(0)$ for all $x$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Evaluate: $g(0) = \sin^2(0) + \cos^2(0) = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  In <a href="../phase0/05-unit-circle.html">Phase 0, page 5</a>, we proved
  $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle.
  That proof required geometry. This one uses only the series definitions, the derivative
  formulas from section 4, and the MVT from Phase 3. Completely algebraic, completely rigorous.
</p>

<h2>6. Closing the IOUs</h2>

<p>
  <strong>$|\sin x| \leq 1$ and $|\cos x| \leq 1$.</strong> Immediate from the Pythagorean
  identity: $\sin^2(x) \leq \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, so $|\sin(x)| \leq 1$. Same for
  $\cos$.
</p>
<p>
  In <a href="../phase0/05-unit-circle.html">Phase 0, page 5</a>, we stated $|\sin\theta|
  \leq 1$ as a geometric fact (the $y$-coordinate on a unit circle cannot exceed $1$). Now
  it is proved from the power series alone.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>$\sin(n)/n \to 0$.</strong> In
  <a href="../phase2/02-squeeze-theorem.html">Phase 2, page 2</a>, we used the squeeze theorem
  with $-1/n \leq \sin(n)/n \leq 1/n$. That argument required $|\sin(n)| \leq 1$, which was
  then an IOU. Now it is proved. The squeeze theorem example is fully grounded.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>$\lim_{h \to 0} \sin(h)/h = 1$.</strong> In
  <a href="../phase3/03-trig-derivatives.html">Phase 3, page 3</a>, we proved this with a
  geometric squeeze argument using areas of circular sectors. Here is an alternative proof
  directly from the series:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\frac{\sin(h)}{h} = \frac{1}{h}\left(h - \frac{h^3}{3!} + \frac{h^5}{5!} - \cdots\right) = 1 - \frac{h^2}{3!} + \frac{h^4}{5!} - \cdots$$</div>
<p>
  As $h \to 0$, every term except the leading $1$ vanishes, so $\sin(h)/h \to 1$. This is
  more direct than the geometric argument and requires no pictures at all.
</p>

<h2>7. Connecting to the geometric definition</h2>

<p>
  We now have <em>two</em> definitions of sine and cosine: the geometric one (unit circle,
  Phase 0) and the series one (this page). They agree because:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Both satisfy $f'' = -f$ with the same initial conditions ($\sin(0) = 0$, $\sin'(0) = 1$
    for sine; $\cos(0) = 1$, $\cos'(0) = 0$ for cosine).</li>
  <li>The solution to $f'' = -f$ with given initial conditions is unique (this will be proved
    in Phase 8 via Cauchy-Lipschitz; for now, it can be verified directly by showing that the
    difference between any two solutions has identically zero derivative, hence is constant,
    hence zero by the initial conditions).</li>
</ol>
<p>
  So the series functions <em>are</em> the geometric sine and cosine. Every property proved
  geometrically in Phase 0 &mdash; the unit circle relationship, the Pythagorean identity, the
  angle-addition formulas &mdash; now has a series-based proof as well. The geometric and
  analytic perspectives agree completely.
</p>

<h2>8. Addition formulas from the series</h2>

<p>
  For completeness, here are the addition formulas proved from the series. The proof mirrors
  the functional equation of $\exp$ (<a href="03-exponential.html">page 3, section 5</a>):
  expand the Cauchy products and rearrange.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Addition formulas</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$\sin(a + b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b)$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$\cos(a + b) = \cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b)$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof sketch</div>
  <p>
    Define $f(b) = \sin(a+b) - \sin(a)\cos(b) - \cos(a)\sin(b)$. Then:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$f'(b) = \cos(a+b) + \sin(a)\sin(b) - \cos(a)\cos(b)$$</div>
  <div class="display-math">$$f''(b) = -\sin(a+b) + \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b) = -f(b)$$</div>
  <p>
    So $f'' = -f$. Also $f(0) = \sin(a) - \sin(a) \cdot 1 - \cos(a) \cdot 0 = 0$ and
    $f'(0) = \cos(a) + 0 - \cos(a) = 0$. The function $h(b) = f(b)^2 + f'(b)^2$ satisfies
    $h'(b) = 2f(b)f'(b) + 2f'(b)f''(b) = 2f'(b)(f(b) - f(b)) = 0$, so $h$ is constant
    and $h(b) = h(0) = 0$. Therefore $f(b) = 0$ for all $b$.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cosine formula follows by differentiating with respect to $b$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<h2>9. Euler's formula (preview)</h2>

<p>
  Compare the three series side by side:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\exp(ix) = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \cdots$$</div>
<p>
  Using $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, the real and imaginary parts separate:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\exp(ix) = \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots\right) + i\left(x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots\right) = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$$</div>
<p>
  This is <strong>Euler's formula</strong>. The exponential, sine, and cosine &mdash; three
  seemingly unrelated functions &mdash; are facets of the same object when extended to complex
  numbers. Setting $x = \pi$ gives $e^{i\pi} = -1$, connecting the five fundamental constants
  $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, $0$ in one equation.
</p>
<p>
  (IOU: this is informal since we have not defined complex power series or proved that the
  manipulation of $i$ within the series is valid. A full treatment requires complex analysis.
  But the pattern is too beautiful and too useful not to mention.)
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Newton (1669) computed the power series for $\sin$ by inverting the series for $\arcsin$
    (obtained by integrating $1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ via the binomial series). Euler (1748) derived
    the series directly from the exponential via $e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$ in his
    <em>Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum</em>, treating the relationship as self-evident.
    The rigorous approach &mdash; defining $\sin$ and $\cos$ by their power series and deriving
    all properties algebraically &mdash; was established by Weierstrass in the 1860s as part of
    his programme to build analysis without geometric intuition.

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the alternating signs:</strong> the series $x + x^3/3! + x^5/5! + \cdots$
    (all positive) defines $\sinh(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2$, the hyperbolic sine. It satisfies
    $\sinh'' = +\sinh$ (not $-\sinh$), grows exponentially, and does <em>not</em> satisfy
    $\sinh^2 + \cosh^2 = 1$. (Instead, $\cosh^2 - \sinh^2 = 1$.) The alternating signs are
    what create oscillation and boundedness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the Pythagorean identity:</strong> if $\sin^2 + \cos^2 \neq 1$, the bound
    $|\sin x| \leq 1$ falls apart, the Taylor remainder estimate fails, and we cannot confirm
    that the series converges to the geometric sine. The identity is load-bearing &mdash; remove
    it and the entire edifice collapses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the series (geometric definition only):</strong> the geometric definition
    requires the concept of arc length on the unit circle, which in turn requires integration
    ($\int \sqrt{1 + y'^2}\, dx$), which requires defining $\sin$ and $\cos$ to compute the
    integrand. There is a hidden circularity in the geometric approach. The series definition
    avoids this entirely: $\sin$ and $\cos$ are defined by pure arithmetic.
