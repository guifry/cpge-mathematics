<h1>Taylor's Theorem</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 4 &mdash; Power Series and Taylor, Page 1</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    Newton (1660s) had a radical insight: forget trying to compute with complicated functions
    directly. Instead, write them as <strong>infinite polynomials</strong>. Polynomials are easy
    &mdash; you can add, multiply, differentiate, and integrate them with nothing more than
    arithmetic. If you could express $\sin(x)$, $e^x$, or $\ln(1+x)$ as a polynomial with
    infinitely many terms, you could compute with them just as easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    But two questions arise immediately. First, <em>which</em> polynomial? Given a function $f$,
    how do you find the coefficients of its infinite polynomial? Second, <em>how good</em> is the
    approximation? If you truncate after $n$ terms, how large is the error? Taylor (1715)
    answered both questions in one theorem.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. The idea: matching derivatives</h2>

<p>
  Suppose you want to approximate $f(x)$ near a point $a$ by a polynomial. The simplest
  approximation is the constant $f(a)$ &mdash; correct at $x = a$ but ignoring all variation.
  The next step is the linear approximation $f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)$: the tangent line
  (<a href="../phase3/01-derivative.html">Phase 3, page 1</a>). This matches $f$ in both
  value and slope at $x = a$.
</p>
<p>
  Why stop at slope? Match the <strong>curvature</strong> too, using the second derivative.
  Then the third derivative. Then the fourth. The more derivatives you match, the closer the
  polynomial hugs the function near $a$.
</p>
<p>
  The question is: what coefficients make a polynomial $P(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 +
  \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n$ satisfy $P^{(k)}(a) = f^{(k)}(a)$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n$?
</p>

<h2>2. Finding the coefficients</h2>

<p>
  Write $P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k (x - a)^k$. Differentiate $k$ times and evaluate at $x = a$.
  All terms vanish except the $k$-th, because differentiating $(x-a)^j$ exactly $k$ times gives
  $j(j-1)\cdots(j-k+1)(x-a)^{j-k}$, which is zero at $x = a$ when $j > k$ and a constant when
  $j = k$.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, $P^{(k)}(a) = k! \cdot c_k$. So matching $P^{(k)}(a) = f^{(k)}(a)$ forces:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}$$</div>
<p>
  The factorial is not a choice &mdash; it is forced by the requirement that derivatives match.
  The $k!$ appears because differentiating $x^k$ exactly $k$ times gives $k!$, so you must
  divide by $k!$ to cancel it.
</p>

<h2>3. The Taylor polynomial</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Taylor polynomial of degree $n$</div>
  <p>
    Let $f$ be $n$ times differentiable at $a$. The <strong>Taylor polynomial of degree $n$</strong>
    of $f$ centred at $a$ is:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k$$</div>
  <p>
    When $a = 0$, this is also called the <strong>Maclaurin polynomial</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  By construction, $T_n$ agrees with $f$ in its value and first $n$ derivatives at $x = a$.
  No other polynomial of degree $\leq n$ does this.
</p>

<h2>4. Example: Taylor polynomials of $e^x$ at $a = 0$</h2>

<p>
  The exponential function (which we will define rigorously from this series on
  <a href="03-exponential.html">page 3</a>) satisfies $f^{(k)}(x) = e^x$ for all $k$, so
  $f^{(k)}(0) = 1$ for every $k$. The Taylor polynomials are:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{x^k}{k!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}$$</div>
<p>
  Each additional term improves the approximation. $T_1(x) = 1 + x$ is the tangent line.
  $T_2(x) = 1 + x + x^2/2$ matches the curvature. $T_5$ is already nearly indistinguishable
  from $e^x$ on $[-2, 2]$.
</p>

<h2>5. Example: Taylor polynomials of $\sin(x)$ at $a = 0$</h2>

<p>
  The derivatives of $\sin$ cycle: $\sin, \cos, -\sin, -\cos, \sin, \ldots$, giving values at
  $0$ of $0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, \ldots$. Only odd powers survive:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$T_{2n+1}(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$</div>
<p>
  The first approximation $T_1(x) = x$ explains the small-angle approximation $\sin(\theta)
  \approx \theta$ that physicists use for pendulums. Higher-order terms correct for larger
  angles.
</p>

<h2>6. Taylor's theorem: the error term</h2>

<p>
  The Taylor polynomial matches $f$ perfectly at $a$ and approximates it nearby. But how large
  is the error $f(x) - T_n(x)$? Taylor's theorem answers this by giving an explicit formula
  for the remainder.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Taylor's theorem (Lagrange form of the remainder)</div>
  <p>
    Let $f$ be $(n+1)$ times differentiable on an interval $I$ containing $a$. Then for every
    $x \in I$, there exists $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$ such that:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$</div>
  <p>
    The last term is the <strong>Lagrange remainder</strong>:
    $R_n(x) = \dfrac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The remainder looks exactly like the next term in the Taylor polynomial, except $f^{(n+1)}(a)$
  is replaced by $f^{(n+1)}(c)$ for some unknown $c$ between $a$ and $x$. You do not know $c$
  exactly &mdash; but you do not need to. For bounding the error, it suffices to bound
  $|f^{(n+1)}|$ on the interval $[a, x]$.
</p>

<h2>7. Proof of Taylor's theorem</h2>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. Define the remainder.</strong>
    Let $R_n(x) = f(x) - T_n(x)$. We need to show this has the Lagrange form.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. Properties of $R_n$.</strong>
    Since $T_n$ matches $f$ in its first $n$ derivatives at $a$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_n(a) = R_n'(a) = R_n''(a) = \cdots = R_n^{(n)}(a) = 0$$</div>
  <p>
    Also, $R_n^{(n+1)}(t) = f^{(n+1)}(t)$ for all $t$, since $T_n$ is a polynomial of degree
    $n$ whose $(n+1)$-th derivative is zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 3. Set up a Cauchy MVT argument.</strong>
    Define $g(t) = (x - t)^{n+1}$. Note that $g(a) = (x-a)^{n+1}$, $g(x) = 0$, and
    $g'(t) = -(n+1)(x-t)^n$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apply the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem
    (<a href="../phase3/05-lhopital.html">Phase 3, page 5</a>) to $R_n$ and $g$ on $[a, x]$
    (or $[x, a]$ if $x < a$). There exists $c_1$ between $a$ and $x$ with:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{R_n(x) - R_n(a)}{g(x) - g(a)} = \frac{R_n'(c_1)}{g'(c_1)}$$</div>
  <p>
    Since $R_n(a) = 0$ and $g(x) = 0$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{R_n(x)}{-(x-a)^{n+1}} = \frac{R_n'(c_1)}{-(n+1)(x-c_1)^n}$$</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 4. Repeat.</strong>
    Since $R_n'(a) = 0$, apply the Cauchy MVT again to $R_n'$ and $(x-t)^n$ on $[a, c_1]$.
    There exists $c_2$ between $a$ and $c_1$ with a similar ratio. Continue $n$ times total.
    After $n$ applications, we reach:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\frac{R_n(x)}{(x-a)^{n+1}} = \frac{R_n^{(n)}(c_n)}{n! \cdot (n+1)(x - c_n)}$$</div>
  <p>
    where $c_n$ is between $a$ and $c_{n-1}$ (hence between $a$ and $x$).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 5. One final application.</strong>
    $R_n^{(n)}(a) = 0$ still, and $R_n^{(n)}$ is differentiable with $R_n^{(n+1)} = f^{(n+1)}$.
    Apply the ordinary MVT to $R_n^{(n)}$ on $[a, c_n]$: there exists $c$ between $a$ and $c_n$
    with $R_n^{(n)}(c_n) = R_n^{(n+1)}(c) \cdot (c_n - a) = f^{(n+1)}(c)(c_n - a)$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Substituting back and simplifying the telescoping factors yields:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{n+1}$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<h2>8. The integral form of the remainder</h2>

<p>
  There is a second expression for $R_n$ that uses integration rather than a mystery point $c$.
  It is often more useful for proving that the remainder tends to zero.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Integral remainder</div>
  <p>
    Under the same hypotheses, and if $f^{(n+1)}$ is continuous:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_n(x) = \int_a^x \frac{f^{(n+1)}(t)}{n!}(x - t)^n\, dt$$</div>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof (by induction using integration by parts)</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Base case ($n = 0$).</strong>
    $R_0(x) = f(x) - f(a)$. By the FTC
    (<a href="../phase3/08-fundamental-theorem.html">Phase 3, page 8</a>):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$f(x) - f(a) = \int_a^x f'(t)\, dt$$</div>
  <p>
    This matches $\int_a^x \frac{f^{(1)}(t)}{0!}(x-t)^0\, dt = \int_a^x f'(t)\, dt$. &#10003;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Inductive step.</strong>
    Assume the formula holds for $n-1$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_{n-1}(x) = \int_a^x \frac{f^{(n)}(t)}{(n-1)!}(x-t)^{n-1}\, dt$$</div>
  <p>
    Apply integration by parts with $u = f^{(n)}(t)/(n-1)!$ and $dv = (x-t)^{n-1}\, dt$,
    so $du = f^{(n+1)}(t)/(n-1)!\, dt$ and $v = -(x-t)^n / n$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_{n-1}(x) = \left[-\frac{f^{(n)}(t)}{n!}(x-t)^n\right]_a^x + \int_a^x \frac{f^{(n+1)}(t)}{n!}(x-t)^n\, dt$$</div>
  <p>
    The boundary term evaluates to $0 - \left(-\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n\right) = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now $R_{n-1}(x) = R_n(x) + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$ (since $T_n = T_{n-1}$ plus that
    last term). Therefore:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$R_n(x) = R_{n-1}(x) - \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n = \int_a^x \frac{f^{(n+1)}(t)}{n!}(x-t)^n\, dt$$</div>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<h2>9. Using the remainder: bounding the error</h2>

<p>
  The Lagrange remainder gives a practical error bound. If $|f^{(n+1)}(t)| \leq M$ for all $t$
  between $a$ and $x$, then:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$|R_n(x)| \leq \frac{M}{(n+1)!}|x - a|^{n+1}$$</div>
<p>
  The factorial in the denominator grows much faster than any power in the numerator. This means
  that for many functions (where the derivatives do not grow too fast), $R_n(x) \to 0$ as
  $n \to \infty$, and the Taylor series converges to $f(x)$. We will verify this explicitly for
  $e^x$ on <a href="03-exponential.html">page 3</a> and for $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$ on
  <a href="04-trig-series.html">page 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
  But this is <em>not</em> automatic. There exist smooth functions where $R_n(x) \not\to 0$ for
  $x \neq a$ &mdash; the Taylor series converges, but not to $f$. The standard example is
  $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ (with $f(0) = 0$), whose derivatives at $0$ are all zero. Its Taylor
  series at $0$ is identically zero, yet $f(x) > 0$ for $x \neq 0$. The remainder never shrinks.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Brook Taylor published the theorem in 1715 in <em>Methodus Incrementorum Directa et
    Inversa</em>, though he stated it without the remainder term. James Gregory (1668) and
    Newton (1690s) had independently discovered specific instances of the series &mdash; Newton
    used the binomial series extensively. Colin Maclaurin popularised the $a = 0$ case in his
    1742 <em>Treatise of Fluxions</em>, giving it the name "Maclaurin series."
  </p>
  <p>
    The crucial addition was the remainder. Lagrange (1797) gave the form we proved above.
    Cauchy later gave the integral form, which is more flexible. Without the remainder, the
    Taylor polynomial is merely a formal trick; with it, the polynomial becomes a quantitative
    tool with known precision.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Without enough differentiability:</strong> the Taylor polynomial of degree $n$
    requires $n$ derivatives at $a$. The remainder in Lagrange form requires $(n+1)$.
    For a function like $f(x) = x^{5/2}$, which is only twice differentiable at $0$, you
    cannot write a Taylor polynomial beyond degree $2$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>When the remainder does not vanish:</strong> $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ (with $f(0) = 0$)
    is infinitely differentiable everywhere, and all its derivatives at $0$ are zero. So every
    Taylor polynomial at $0$ is the zero polynomial. The Taylor series is $0 + 0 + 0 + \cdots
    = 0$, but $f(x) \neq 0$ for $x \neq 0$. The function is "too flat" at the origin for the
    series to detect its behaviour elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Without the $(n+1)!$ denominator:</strong> the factorial is what makes the remainder
    shrink. If the bound on $|f^{(n+1)}|$ grows no faster than $C^n$ for some constant $C$
    (which holds for $e^x$, $\sin$, $\cos$), the factorial wins and $R_n \to 0$. If the
    derivatives grow as fast as $(n+1)!$ itself, the factorial merely cancels and the remainder
    need not tend to zero.
  </p>
