<h1>Term-by-Term Operations</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Phase 4 &mdash; Power Series and Taylor, Page 5</p>

<div class="problem-box">
  <div class="label">The problem</div>
  <p>
    On <a href="03-exponential.html">page 3</a> we differentiated $\exp(x) = \sum x^n/n!$ term
    by term and got $\exp'(x) = \exp(x)$. On <a href="04-trig-series.html">page 4</a> we
    differentiated $\sin$ and $\cos$ term by term to get $\sin' = \cos$ and $\cos' = -\sin$.
    Each time, we treated the infinite sum like a finite one &mdash; differentiating each term
    separately.
  </p>
  <p>
    But differentiation is a <strong>limit</strong> (the limit of the difference quotient), and
    a power series is another <strong>limit</strong> (the limit of partial sums). We are
    swapping two limits. In general, this is <em>illegal</em>: there are sequences of
    differentiable functions whose termwise derivative does not equal the derivative of the
    limit. When, and why, is it legal for power series?
  </p>
</div>

<h2>1. Why the swap can fail</h2>

<p>
  Consider the functions $f_n(x) = \frac{\sin(nx)}{n}$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Each $f_n$ is
  differentiable with $f_n'(x) = \cos(nx)$. As $n \to \infty$, $f_n(x) \to 0$ for every $x$
  (because $|\sin(nx)/n| \leq 1/n$). So the limit function is $f(x) = 0$, and $f'(x) = 0$.
</p>
<p>
  But the derivatives $f_n'(x) = \cos(nx)$ do not converge to $0$. At $x = 0$, $f_n'(0) = 1$
  for all $n$. The termwise derivative $\lim f_n'$ is not $f' = 0$. The swap fails because the
  convergence $f_n \to f$ is only <strong>pointwise</strong>, not
  <strong>uniform</strong>.
</p>

<h2>2. Uniform convergence: the key condition</h2>

<p>
  The distinction between pointwise and uniform convergence is the heart of the matter. Phase 5
  will treat this in full generality (Weierstrass M-test, uniform convergence preserving
  continuity). Here we state what is needed for power series.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Definition &mdash; Uniform convergence</div>
  <p>
    A sequence of functions $f_n$ converges <strong>uniformly</strong> to $f$ on a set $S$ if:
    for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and <em>all
    $x \in S$</em>:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \varepsilon$$</div>
  <p>
    The crucial point: $N$ depends only on $\varepsilon$, not on $x$. The same $N$ works
    everywhere on $S$ simultaneously.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Pointwise convergence says: for each $x$, the sequence $f_n(x)$ gets close to $f(x)$.
  Uniform convergence says: the entire <em>graph</em> of $f_n$ gets close to the graph of
  $f$, everywhere at once. The difference is the order of quantifiers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pointwise: $\forall x,\; \forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists N$...</li>
  <li>Uniform: $\forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists N,\; \forall x$...</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Power series converge uniformly on compact subsets</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem</div>
  <p>
    Let $\sum a_n x^n$ be a power series with radius of convergence $R > 0$. For any
    $0 < r < R$, the series converges uniformly on $[-r, r]$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    For $|x| \leq r$: $|a_n x^n| \leq |a_n| r^n$. Since $r < R$, the series $\sum |a_n| r^n$
    converges (absolute convergence inside the radius,
    <a href="02-power-series.html">page 2</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Define $M_n = |a_n| r^n$. Then $|a_n x^n| \leq M_n$ for all $x \in [-r, r]$, and
    $\sum M_n$ converges. By the Weierstrass M-test (which we state here and prove in Phase 5):
    if $|f_n(x)| \leq M_n$ for all $x$ in a set $S$, and $\sum M_n$ converges, then
    $\sum f_n$ converges uniformly on $S$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore $\sum a_n x^n$ converges uniformly on $[-r, r]$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  The key word is "compact subset": any closed interval $[-r, r]$ with $r < R$. The series
  need not converge uniformly on the entire open interval $(-R, R)$ &mdash; convergence can
  slow down as $|x|$ approaches $R$. But on any proper compact subset, convergence is uniform.
  This is enough for all our applications.
</p>

<h2>4. Term-by-term differentiation</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Differentiating a power series</div>
  <p>
    Let $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with radius of convergence $R > 0$. Then $f$ is
    differentiable on $(-R, R)$ and:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n x^{n-1} \qquad \text{for all } |x| < R$$</div>
  <p>
    Moreover, the differentiated series has the same radius of convergence $R$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof outline</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 1. The differentiated series has the same radius.</strong>
    The coefficients of the differentiated series are $b_n = (n+1)a_{n+1}$. By
    Cauchy-Hadamard (<a href="02-power-series.html">page 2</a>):
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\limsup |b_n|^{1/n} = \limsup |(n+1)a_{n+1}|^{1/n} = \limsup |a_{n+1}|^{1/n}$$</div>
  <p>
    (since $(n+1)^{1/n} \to 1$). This equals $\limsup |a_n|^{1/n} = 1/R$. So the
    differentiated series has the same radius $R$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step 2. The derivative equals the termwise derivative.</strong>
    Fix $x$ with $|x| < R$. Choose $r$ with $|x| < r < R$. The series $\sum n a_n t^{n-1}$
    converges uniformly on $[-r, r]$ (by the M-test argument of section 3, applied to the
    differentiated series). Uniform convergence of derivatives, combined with convergence of
    the original series at a single point, allows swapping the derivative with the sum.
    (The full proof uses the mean value theorem to control the difference quotients; we defer
    the technical details to Phase 5, where uniform convergence is treated systematically.)
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  Since the differentiated series has the same radius, you can differentiate again, and again.
  By induction, <strong>a power series is infinitely differentiable inside its radius of
  convergence</strong>, and each successive derivative is obtained by term-by-term
  differentiation.
</p>

<h2>5. Term-by-term integration</h2>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Integrating a power series</div>
  <p>
    Let $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with radius of convergence $R > 0$. Then for
    any $x$ with $|x| < R$:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_0^x f(t)\, dt = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{n+1} x^{n+1}$$</div>
  <p>
    The integrated series has the same radius of convergence $R$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Fix $x$ with $|x| < R$ and choose $r$ with $|x| < r < R$. On $[-r, r]$, the series
    $\sum a_n t^n$ converges uniformly (section 3). Uniform convergence allows swapping
    integral and sum:
  </p>
  <div class="display-math">$$\int_0^x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n\, dt = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_0^x a_n t^n\, dt = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n x^{n+1}}{n+1}$$</div>
  <p>
    The swap is justified because for a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions on a
    compact interval, integrating the sum equals the sum of the integrals. (This is a standard
    theorem; we use it here and prove it in Phase 5.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The integrated series has coefficients $b_n = a_{n-1}/n$ (for $n \geq 1$). By
    Cauchy-Hadamard: $\limsup |b_n|^{1/n} = \limsup |a_{n-1}/n|^{1/n} = \limsup |a_n|^{1/n}
    = 1/R$. Same radius.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<h2>6. Application: the series for $\ln(1 + x)$</h2>

<p>
  We know $\frac{1}{1+t} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n t^n$ for $|t| < 1$ (geometric series
  with $-t$). Integrate both sides from $0$ to $x$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\int_0^x \frac{dt}{1+t} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$$</div>
<p>
  The left side is $\ln(1+x)$ (since $\ln' = 1/x$, as proved on
  <a href="03-exponential.html">page 3</a>). So:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \cdots = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} x^n \qquad \text{for } |x| < 1$$</div>
<p>
  This closes the remaining IOU from Phase 3: the logarithm now has an explicit series
  representation, derived from the geometric series and term-by-term integration. On
  <a href="06-abel-theorem.html">page 6</a>, we will extend this to $x = 1$ and show
  $\ln(2) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + \cdots$.
</p>

<h2>7. Application: the series for $\arctan(x)$</h2>

<p>
  Similarly: $\frac{1}{1+t^2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n t^{2n}$ for $|t| < 1$ (substitute
  $-t^2$ into the geometric series). Integrate from $0$ to $x$:
</p>
<div class="display-math">$$\arctan(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{1+t^2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} x^{2n+1} = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \cdots$$</div>
<p>
  for $|x| < 1$. This is the <strong>Leibniz-Gregory series</strong>. On
  <a href="06-abel-theorem.html">page 6</a>, Abel's theorem will let us set $x = 1$ and
  obtain the beautiful formula $\pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + \cdots$.
</p>

<h2>8. The power series is uniquely determined</h2>

<p>
  An important consequence of term-by-term differentiation: if two power series agree on an
  open interval around $0$, their coefficients must be identical.
</p>

<div class="theorem-box">
  <div class="label">Theorem &mdash; Uniqueness of coefficients</div>
  <p>
    If $\sum a_n x^n = \sum b_n x^n$ for all $x$ in some open interval $(-\delta, \delta)$
    with $\delta > 0$, then $a_n = b_n$ for all $n$.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="proof-box">
  <div class="label">Proof</div>
  <p>
    Let $f(x) = \sum a_n x^n = \sum b_n x^n$. Setting $x = 0$: $a_0 = f(0) = b_0$.
    Differentiate (term by term, legal inside the radius): $f'(x) = \sum n a_n x^{n-1} =
    \sum n b_n x^{n-1}$. Set $x = 0$: $a_1 = f'(0) = b_1$. Differentiate again:
    $a_2 = f''(0)/2 = b_2$. By induction, $a_n = f^{(n)}(0)/n! = b_n$ for all $n$.
  </p>
  <div class="qed">&#8718;</div>
</div>

<p>
  This means the Taylor series of a function (if it exists and converges) is the <em>only</em>
  power series representing that function. The coefficients $f^{(n)}(a)/n!$ are forced.
</p>

<div class="history-box">
  <div class="label">Historical note</div>
  <p>
    Euler (18th century) freely differentiated and integrated power series term by term without
    justification. He obtained correct results because the series he worked with were well-behaved
    (power series with large radii of convergence). Abel (1826) was among the first to notice
    that term-by-term operations can fail for general series of functions, writing that "the
    properties of infinite series are not always what a hasty extrapolation from finite sums
    would suggest."
  </p>
  <p>
    Cauchy (1821) attempted to prove that a convergent series of continuous functions is
    continuous &mdash; and got it wrong, because he did not distinguish pointwise from uniform
    convergence. Weierstrass (1841) identified uniform convergence as the correct condition
    and built the rigorous framework we use today. The fact that power series converge uniformly
    on compact subsets &mdash; making all term-by-term operations safe inside the radius &mdash;
    is a special property of power series, not of arbitrary function series.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="break-box">
  <div class="label">What breaks</div>
  <p>
    <strong>Without uniform convergence:</strong> the Fourier series
    $\sum \frac{\sin(nx)}{n}$ converges pointwise but <em>not</em> uniformly on $(0, 2\pi)$.
    Term-by-term differentiation gives $\sum \cos(nx)$, which diverges almost everywhere. The
    derivative of the sum is not the sum of the derivatives. This is why we need the uniform
    convergence guarantee that power series provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>At the boundary $|x| = R$:</strong> the theorems above apply only for $|x| < R$.
    At the boundary, convergence may fail to be uniform, and term-by-term operations require
    extra care. Abel's theorem (<a href="06-abel-theorem.html">page 6</a>) handles one
    important case: evaluating the sum at the boundary by taking a limit from inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>For non-power-series:</strong> arbitrary series of functions $\sum f_n(x)$ do
    not automatically converge uniformly on compact sets. The M-test (Phase 5) gives a sufficient
    condition, but it must be checked case by case. Power series are special because the geometric
    comparison in <a href="02-power-series.html">page 2</a> automatically provides the dominant
    series $\sum M_n$ needed for the M-test.
  </p>
